c50392,s1,Our first impression of Sheraton Macao Hotel was too crowded; there are so many people in the lobby area and even with so many people service is above average,,,,,,,,
c50392,s2,Luckily as we are Starwood members we were checked-in in the Club Lounge with less people,,,,,,,,
c50392,s3,"The room is nice, clean and good in size",,,,,,,,
c50393,s1,I stayed at Sheraton Macau for 3 nights,,,,,,,,
c50393,s2,We ordered coffee capsules which was scheduled to be delivered to us at the hotel during these 3 days,,,,,,,,
c50393,s3,"As we went with a group tour, our names weren't match with the reservation name because tour guide had rearranged new room for our family to stay on the same floor",,,,,,,,
c50393,s4,We then talked to staff at the concierge desk about this situation since the first day that we had arrived,,,,,,,,
c50393,s5,"We provided them room number, our names, order number and pretty much everything",,,,,,,,
c50393,s6,We reconfirmed with the staff many times but they refused to collect our parcels when it was delivered to the concierge desk,,,,,,,,
c50393,s7,The reason given to the carrier company was that the name did not match with the reservation name even the room number and our names were shown on the parcel,,,,,,,,
c50393,s8,_,,,,,,,,
c50394,s1,I have stayed here twice,,,,,,,,
c50394,s2,"Last year, I booked a room for 4 persons on SPG's website, made it confirmed by e-mail from the hotel that the room was for 4 persons",,,,,,,,
c50394,s3,"But, they gave me a room with just 1 king bed when I checked in",,,,,,,,
c50394,s4,"I was flustered, and the reception said that they don't have a room for 4 persons except for a suite",,,,,,,,
c50394,s5,"To make matters worse, they suggested me to upgrade to a suite with additional pay because all the deluxe rooms were fully booked",,,,,,,,
c50394,s6,"Anyway, they put some extra beds in a room and I had no other choice",,,,,,,,
c50394,s7,"I had complained, and Guest Service Manager offered me a complimentary room upgrade for next visit",,,,,,,,
c50394,s8,I had another chance to visit Macau early in Jan,,,,,,,,
c50394,s9,This time I'd booked a room and asked the Guest Service Manager if the last offer was still valid,,,,,,,,
c50394,s10,He didn't_,,,,,,,,
c50395,s1,Was expecting more from sheraton,,,,,,,,
c50395,s2,The building and rooms are a bit old and wornout,,,,,,,,
c50395,s3,I guess is just good for location and casinos,,,,,,,,
c50395,s4,is conveneient but not that delightful for the rooms,,,,,,,,
c50395,s5,For this price  i believe i can have better options,,,,,,,,
c50396,s1,We booked this hotel after losing a passport; we originally spent the night at another hotel but the rates were not within our budget for multiple nights so we decided to move over to this hotel,,,,,,,,
c50396,s2,We arrived early but rooms were available so they let us check-in,,,,,,,,
c50396,s3,We used room service and the food was mediocre but it satisfied our late night hunger,,,,,,,,
c50396,s4,The rooms themselves are clean and pretty large but they could use some updating,,,,,,,,
c50396,s5,"The hotel is HUGE so there is not a very personal feel, but that was to be expected",,,,,,,,
c50396,s6,Added bonus for pictures with Shrek!,,,,,,,,
c50397,s1,"While the hotel is clean modern and the rooms are good, it just feels like the hotel is not up to the standards of a typical Sheraton hotel elsewhere",,,,,,,,
c50397,s2,"Situated on top of a casino with crowds coming in and out every day, the place is busy and you don't feel as if you are in a luxury/Exclusive hotel (well they certainly have not priced it as a luxury hotel I have to agree)",,,,,,,,
c50397,s3,The check in queue was very long and you feel being rushed,,,,,,,,
c50397,s4,"Everything is some distance away, including the walk from the check in desk to the lift where your room is",,,,,,,,
c50397,s5,"Other than that, there isn't much to complain about the room I guess, it is modern and clean",,,,,,,,
c50397,s6,"There isn't much they can do to be honest, this is one of three (4 soon) hotels on top of a massive casino and is designed to provide affordable beds_",,,,,,,,
c50398,s1,I visited the Sherton Macao Hotel during summer holiday with kids,,,,,,,,
c50398,s2,"When I arrived, they check in area had a very long queue, I guessed there was over 300 people in the lobby waiting for check-in",,,,,,,,
c50398,s3,There was some staffs to maintain the queue in good order,,,,,,,,
c50398,s4,I waited more than one hour to get the room key,,,,,,,,
c50398,s5,The front desk staff was too tired to offer a smile,,,,,,,,
c50398,s6,Not a warm welcome,,,,,,,,
c50398,s7,"The room was clean, I had left a top in the room afte departure however no one contact me for the lost and found during my stay",,,,,,,,
c50398,s8,Perhaps the Housekeeping was too busy? The room package included daily breakfast or lunch,,,,,,,,
c50398,s9,The food and service in Feast was very good,,,,,,,,
c50398,s10,"The hotel had shuttle bus to Cotai ferry, however the other hotels would have shuttle bus to other areas in Macao",,,,,,,,
c50398,s11,We had to take taxi when we went_,,,,,,,,
c50399,s1,Sheraton Macau is one of the lowest grade hotel for this brand,,,,,,,,
c50399,s2,Stayed there 2 nights and cannot believed they used such low end  products across the room,,,,,,,,
c50399,s3,The shampoo and soap are unbelievable cheap,,,,,,,,
c50399,s4,There is No security at all,,,,,,,,
c50399,s5,Anyone can get access to all floor as they do not have lift control,,,,,,,,
c50399,s6,This is one of the lowest standard of  Sheraton in Asia,,,,,,,,
c50400,s1,We had a good experience here despite the check-in line being ridiculously long,,,,,,,,
c50400,s2,The staff were very accommodating,,,,,,,,
c50400,s3,The room was great and we had a nice view of the pool,,,,,,,,
c50400,s4,The bell boys helped us explain to the cab driver where we wanted to go and gave us a small card with translations to help us better communicate with the driver,,,,,,,,
c50401,s1,"I was not enjoy my stay on 24~28 Oct, no show on 24 Oct,then check in on 25 Oct, reception counter full of staff but look so messy, receptionist seem like not so familiar with the system, after i enter the room, found a soap (used) on laundry basket, 27 Oct i back to room at night, room simply clean, found cup and coffee pot unclean, bed sheet like unchange, dust on carpet, seem no vacumm at all, and room svs tray still on the desk, no one take it out, so i put outside my room, but when i check out this morning, still at the same location, i don't know the standard for extend guest and new guest, that's make me quiet disappointed",,,,,,,,
c50401,s2,I don't think i will stay there again,,,,,,,,
c50402,s1,Stayed for 3 nights,,,,,,,,
c50402,s2,Booked on a Club Loung basis,,,,,,,,
c50402,s3,The check in located on the 4th Floor is designed to give a superior experience this was not the case,,,,,,,,
c50402,s4,"There are potentially 8 check in positions, at the time of our check in only 2 were in use",,,,,,,,
c50402,s5,"One of the two was dealing with a client on a protracted matter the other was the sole interface with the new registrations, the time spent waiting was in access of 20 minutes",,,,,,,,
c50402,s6,I consider this to be unacceptable,,,,,,,,
c50402,s7,"Our Club Room was on the 31st Floor, for a 5* hotel this was dissapointing and the room  can only be described as basic and underwhelming, certainly not to the standard I was expecting",,,,,,,,
c50402,s8,"On a positive note the arrangements in the Club Lounge were very good with light refreshments , tea , coffee and sandwiches available in the_",,,,,,,,
c50403,s1,"My family and I stayed in a family (2 bed) suite last month, and were incredibly underwhelmed by the Sheraton",,,,,,,,
c50403,s2,"We came on a busy weekend with a Bon Jovi concert in the neighbouring Venetian, so when we walked in at 3",,,,,,,,
c50403,s3,30pm the queue for checking in must have been an hour long,,,,,,,,
c50403,s4,"We were ushered to an upstairs check-in area, which was only a HALF hour long! Upon checking in we were told that our room was not ready yet, and were shown to the lounge, where we were provided 1 drink each - there was no food, and by this stage the kids were hungry and miserable",,,,,,,,
c50403,s5,"The suite was quite nice, with bunk beds for the kids and Madagascar themed accessories for them too",,,,,,,,
c50403,s6,"Wi-fi was poor throughout the hotel, even in the room",,,,,,,,
c50403,s7,The breakfast area was about a half-hour walk from our room to the_,,,,,,,,
c50404,s1,We chose this for a short break with our 4 year old twins,,,,,,,,
c50404,s2,First impression was a chaotic lobby and long queues but we were quickly ushered upstairs to the SPG lounge by an attentive concierge,,,,,,,,
c50404,s3,It saved embarrassment that I am actually an SPG member,,,,,,,,
c50404,s4,"I'm happy to carry my own luggage, which I guess was a relief as no help was on offer (a first for me - normally there's an embarrassment of service in that area)",,,,,,,,
c50404,s5,"Adjoining rooms were good and the kids' room was bedecked with Dreamworks themed goodies, which was great and one of the reasons we had chosen the Sheraton",,,,,,,,
c50404,s6,We set out to explore lunch options,,,,,,,,
c50404,s7,"Poolside bar menu was sparse, as was the service so we elected for Bene, the Italian on the first floor",,,,,,,,
c50404,s8,Generally pretty good although the waiter got a bit pushy when we only_,,,,,,,,
c50405,s1,i had kept my pasmo/ suica in the card slot,,,,,,,,
c50405,s2,upon returning to my room it was taken,,,,,,,,
c50405,s3,i searched high and low before confirming i needed to contact reception,,,,,,,,
c50405,s4,house keeping found my pasmo/ suica and returned it to my room,,,,,,,,
c50405,s5,(now i am going through my bags ensuring nothing else has been taken 2:30am)  Thanks for a good nights rest,,,,,,,,
c50405,s6,(sarcasm),,,,,,,,
c50406,s1,The hotel was lovely but our holiday was ruined and very disappointed with the check out service,,,,,,,,
c50406,s2,We paid a deposit on arrival and were told we would have the amount credit within 24 hours back onto our credit card it was a moderate amount,,,,,,,,
c50406,s3,3 and half weeks later I was still trying to get that money back I could not get any satisfaction from emails etc,,,,,,,,
c50406,s4,so disappointing from such a large well known company there was a huge mix up and paperwork missing not good enough I will never stay at a Sheraton hotel again I have never had this problem ever all over the whole world,,,,,,,,
c50407,s1,I had a early Ferry __ from Hong Kong to Macau (_) and go to hotel by their shuttle Bus __ __,,,,,,,,
c50407,s2,As a SPG member I go to the SPG counter to check in although I booked the room through travel agent,,,,,,,,
c50407,s3,I understand the earliest time to pick up the room is around 15:00,,,,,,,,
c50407,s4,So I put my luggage at bell service,,,,,,,,
c50407,s5,Friendly SPG staff marked down my phone number and he said hotel will SMS me when the room is really,,,,,,,,
c50407,s6,At last I do not receive the SMS at all,,,,,,,,
c50407,s7,"I come back to hotel around 23:00, I go to pick up the key at SPG counters as well",,,,,,,,
c50407,s8,Everything is fine,,,,,,,,
c50407,s9,"When I go up, I hear some noise inside my room, then I use my key to open the door",,,,,,,,
c50407,s10,I found that a staff is setting up my extra bed which I ordered before,,,,,,,,
c50407,s11,May be I didn't book through SPG for the room they do not give me a SPG room_,,,,,,,,
c50408,s1,Stayed at Sheraton Cotai from 24-28 Sep 2015,,,,,,,,
c50408,s2,"The check-in line was very long, luckily as our group consist of 2 young children (1 was done with fever) and 2 late sixties seniors were directed to the express check-in",,,,,,,,
c50408,s3,I find the hotel concierege are really helpful whenever we approach them for assistance,,,,,,,,
c50408,s4,We would suggest that families with young kids to stay on the peninsula side and most of the tourist spots are located there,,,,,,,,
c50408,s5,The Cotai area is mostly for people visiting the casinos,,,,,,,,
c50408,s6,Our family enjoyed the fantastic House of Dancing Water show,,,,,,,,
c50409,s1,"This is my third time to stay at Sheraton Macao, I am fine with the hotel location, facility and the room is nice",,,,,,,,
c50409,s2,"I had a very disappointing experience - when I check out, I told the reception Miss Chow/Zhou I loss my deposit receipt then she gave me a long face to calculate the deposit balance, then she ""throw the money"" on the reception desk",,,,,,,,
c50409,s3,"I felt embarrassing, I need to meet my friends so I didn't raise complaint to her manager",,,,,,,,
c50409,s4,"Very disappointing service I hope Sheraton to improve their service level, therefore I have to give them only 2-star",,,,,,,,
c50409,s5,"To clarify: this time my room is not complimentary by the Casino, I book thru agent",,,,,,,,
c50410,s1,The problem with this hotel is that it is so massive and loses its exclusivity,,,,,,,,
c50410,s2,It is becoming a really sleazy hotel,,,,,,,,
c50410,s3,There are two towers with a casino at the lobby,,,,,,,,
c50410,s4,"I went there during the China National Day holidays, and boy oh boy",,,,,,,,
c50410,s5,It was so crowded at the lobby,,,,,,,,
c50410,s6,"This is my third stay in this hotel, and I have no idea why I was put at Sky Tower again",,,,,,,,
c50410,s7,"From my observation, it seems that Caucasians were placed in the Earth Tower while Asians, which I am one, were placed in the Sky Tower",,,,,,,,
c50410,s8,"I have never been into the Earth Tower, and hence, can't really comment on the layout, decorations etc",,,,,,,,
c50410,s9,But what I can comment on was the quality of guests in the Sky Tower,,,,,,,,
c50410,s10,"I was placed on a no-smoking floor, and the first thing that I saw when exiting the elevator on my level was a_",,,,,,,,
c50411,s1,Getting to the hotel from ferry terminal _ Free shuttle bus is available at both Macau/Taipa Ferry Terminal,,,,,,,,
c50411,s2,Is very easy and convenient to get to the hotel,,,,,,,,
c50411,s3,"Check in _ First, the building is large and we walked a long way from the shuttle drop-off point to the front desk",,,,,,,,
c50411,s4,"Signage is unclear, we were unsure where to go, lost a few times and finally found the check-in counter",,,,,,,,
c50411,s5,"To our dismay, the queue to check-in is extremely long! We don__ expect this from a 5-star hotel",,,,,,,,
c50411,s6,The area was crowded with people and very noisy,,,,,,,,
c50411,s7,The classy feel of a 5-star hotel was lost at that first sight,,,,,,,,
c50411,s8,"We are a family of 3, my husband, myself and our 18 month old boy",,,,,,,,
c50411,s9,"While I joined the queue to check-in, there is no waiting lounge or couch around the lobby area for my husband and baby to sit and_",,,,,,,,
c50412,s1,Horrible stay,,,,,,,,
c50412,s2,Save your money,,,,,,,,
c50412,s3,This hotel had the dirtiest breakfast buffet I have ever seen,,,,,,,,
c50412,s4,Also the service is far below the other hotels,,,,,,,,
c50412,s5,I will never stay at this property again,,,,,,,,
c50412,s6,Ask for non smoking king yet room smelled of smoke,,,,,,,,
c50412,s7,Overpriced should be a one star motel not even hotel rating,,,,,,,,
c50413,s1,"Keeping in mind this is the biggest Sheraton Hotel in the World, in a tourist hub like Macau, you clearly have to make certain concessions",,,,,,,,
c50413,s2,"Clearly you're not going to get away from the crowds, nor should you really expect to, but certain things which could help aren't particularly thought out",,,,,,,,
c50413,s3,The Sheraton Club for example is MASSIVE and there isn't a slight air of exclusivity - the dining area just feels like another hotel restaurant,,,,,,,,
c50413,s4,As a platinum SPG member I was upgraded to a very comfortable suite and the service was rather good,,,,,,,,
c50413,s5,I ordered an item from the daily menu after 11pm and the staff had no issue at all bringing it to me,,,,,,,,
c50413,s6,I think if TripAdvisor allowed half ratings this would be a 3,,,,,,,,
c50413,s7,5-May,,,,,,,,
c50414,s1,"Honestly, I cannot follow many of those who posted the review here on Tripadvisor",,,,,,,,
c50414,s2,but so be it! I just stayed recently at it was most likely by far the worst experience I had in a so called 5* hotel over the past couple of years,,,,,,,,
c50414,s3,It starts already with the feeling of being a number instead a guest that you have to line up for check in,,,,,,,,
c50414,s4,that alone is already not 5* but the fact the the check in process is slow and many counters are not manned is another fact,,,,,,,,
c50414,s5,The check in was not organized at all and took over 10 minutes leaving the waiting time aside,,,,,,,,
c50414,s6,The staffs was not well trained neither customer oriented,,,,,,,,
c50414,s7,That the lobby has no charm as it is permanently overrun by game machines is a fact that you have to accept when you are in Macau,,,,,,,,
c50414,s8,The whole ambiance just feels odd,,,,,,,,
c50414,s9,_,,,,,,,,
c50415,s1,The hotel itself is pleasant but there's 1 issue with the room,,,,,,,,
c50415,s2,The shower area will flood while taking shower,,,,,,,,
c50415,s3,We request the hotel staff to check it in the morning while we are going out and they promised to check,,,,,,,,
c50415,s4,"But when we are back, it did not fix",,,,,,,,
c50415,s5,We also did tried to call the servicing line but the phone was spoilt,,,,,,,,
c50415,s6,We're not able to call out,,,,,,,,
c50415,s7,So we left a note in the toilet to request them to fix it,,,,,,,,
c50415,s8,There's no response and not fix,,,,,,,,
c50415,s9,So we bare with it for the 4 nights we stayed there,,,,,,,,
c50416,s1,"The first time I stayed here is few months ago, which I just keep moving around, don't really have time to look up the hotel at all, but I got a good first impression back then",,,,,,,,
c50416,s2,"The check in is fast, the lady upgrade me to suite and she was sweet and considerate, it got nothing to do with the elite status yet",,,,,,,,
c50416,s3,"So few months later I returned and stay here for one night for the concert, it turned out to be a huge disappointment",,,,,,,,
c50416,s4,"I arrived at 1800 and it's packed, due to the public holiday and mid-autumn festvial, the place is totally packed",,,,,,,,
c50416,s5,"So I went to the SPG counter, the queue is long and there's only two staff at the counter, and they took ages to finish one check-in, one even keep chatting with the customers on and off",,,,,,,,
c50416,s6,I was in a hurry to fresh up and go for the event,,,,,,,,
c50416,s7,_,,,,,,,,
c50417,s1,Stayed for 1N over the Mid-Autumn Festival,,,,,,,,
c50417,s2,Crowded time to be there but expected better from a 5 star hotel,,,,,,,,
c50417,s3,"The Good: -fast, efficient check-in for SPG members, same for check-out at club lounge  -fast, efficient service by housekeeping when attending to our requests given the size of the hotel",,,,,,,,
c50417,s4,-nice large room -Special mention to Edmund Yong (hope I got your name correctly) at the Club lounge),,,,,,,,
c50417,s5,Our luggage was sent mistakenly to Bell services even though we requested otherwise,,,,,,,,
c50417,s6,He went down with us and personally ensure everything was in order,,,,,,,,
c50417,s7,Thank you Edmund,,,,,,,,
c50417,s8,The Bad: -the so-called club lounge is the worst I have ever been,,,,,,,,
c50417,s9,zero exclusivity with a huge dining area which serves mediocre food,,,,,,,,
c50417,s10,which club lounge has such a big dining area where half the hotel guests seem to_,,,,,,,,
c50418,s1,Stayed for one night due to Bon Jovi concert ( across the road at the Venetian ),,,,,,,,
c50418,s2,This Sheraton claims it is the biggest Sheraton in the world and since they have so many rooms / visitors; they need to have system to match the crowd over the weekends,,,,,,,,
c50418,s3,Basically everything works like clock work ( impressive ) but food is disappointing ( bland ),,,,,,,,
c50418,s4,"Otherwise, sleep quality was good ( good bed ) but the mini fridge was locked and could not get a drink!",,,,,,,,
c50419,s1,Check in and check out is way too slow (even on SPG only line),,,,,,,,
c50419,s2,I am not sure why the hotel staffs need such a long time to complete a standard procedure,,,,,,,,
c50419,s3,"Swimming pool Jaya is close most of the time, disappointing since you pay full price but availability of some amenities are just half of the time",,,,,,,,
c50419,s4,Shower head hose is leaking a lot,,,,,,,,
c50419,s5,"Positive points: very helpful room service, trying their best to help to provide alternative for baby crib (unfortunately unusable as the rail guard is set to lock and cannot be opened), provide plenty of extra drinking water bottles without much questions asked",,,,,,,,
c50419,s6,Most staffs can speak English ok,,,,,,,,
c50419,s7,Room and hotel condition & cleanliness in general are good,,,,,,,,
c50419,s8,"Did not try the hotel restaurants, unfortunately dining options at the adjoining mall is_",,,,,,,,
c50420,s1,"We booked to stay for my birthday, we were staying 2 nights here and then 2 nights in Hong Kong",,,,,,,,
c50420,s2,"This was the 5th time we have stayed in Macau but the first time at the Sheraton, we were debating if we should try this hotel or stay in our favourite which is the Venetian Hotel and we made a big mistake picking this hotel",,,,,,,,
c50420,s3,"We checked in fine, the receptionist was friendly, we loved the room so it was a good start",,,,,,,,
c50420,s4,"However then the hotel had major issues with power outages, we had to get ready for dinner with no lights the first night, the next day (my birthday) the power went again in the afternoon, there were people stuck in lifts screaming and crying, others couldn't get into there room because the keycards weren't working",,,,,,,,
c50420,s5,We came back around 2am and there was still no power_,,,,,,,,
c50421,s1,There are smoking rooms floor at this hotel but I don't smoke,,,,,,,,
c50421,s2,"The room was not worth that much money, probably because of weekend",,,,,,,,
c50421,s3,The breakfast cost 217 HK$ at door and 179 HK$ at checkin,,,,,,,,
c50421,s4,The entertainment playground is rather small with limited tables,,,,,,,,
c50421,s5,It's better go there at day time with less players,,,,,,,,
c50422,s1,Well we were looking forward to  the all round Sheraton experience and we were very disappointed,,,,,,,,
c50422,s2,You can't check in until 1pm,,,,,,,,
c50422,s3,Then at 1pm they cattle que you in long ques,,,,,,,,
c50422,s4,Awful system,,,,,,,,
c50422,s5,Why you can't check in and do all the paperwork and then just grab your keys and bags later like in normal hotels I don't know,,,,,,,,
c50422,s6,Terrible experience,,,,,,,,
c50422,s7,The restaurant is the furthest area away from the rooms so breakfast is a march,,,,,,,,
c50422,s8,Set off 15mins before you're hungry,,,,,,,,
c50422,s9,Nothing is sign posted well except the shops and gambling,,,,,,,,
c50422,s10,Everything else you need to constantly ask for directions,,,,,,,,
c50422,s11,Good fitness and pool facilities,,,,,,,,
c50422,s12,Rooms are dated,,,,,,,,
c50422,s13,Breakfast is OK but nothing special,,,,,,,,
c50422,s14,It seems that the standard and service you get used to from these hotels elsewhere is not continued here Macau,,,,,,,,
c50422,s15,Venetian is_,,,,,,,,
c50423,s1,"Booked a Deluxe Suite as a SPG Gold member, unfortunately, when I arrived at the hotel at around 4pm, the room was not available yet, while the official standard check-in time is 3pm",,,,,,,,
c50423,s2,"And, the front desk staff suggest me to go back at 7pm, without any compensation or temporary room",,,,,,,,
c50423,s3,"It was so disappointing, this is the worst SPG property in the world, this is the third or fourth time I stay at this hotel, and I realized that the service quality at this hotel has been decreasing again and again",,,,,,,,
c50423,s4,"Friends, you may want to try some other new hotels around, unless only paying for the name of Sheraton",,,,,,,,
c50424,s1,Rooms are ok - what you would expect from a Sheraton,,,,,,,,
c50424,s2,The food options are pretty poor,,,,,,,,
c50424,s3,Italian restaurant is below average,,,,,,,,
c50424,s4,Even the Chinese restaurant is below average!!!  Pools are great - they serve better food there,,,,,,,,
c50424,s5,Although they close the bar/food way too early in the evening!!!  Worst thing is that it's located in Macau - a poor man's Vegas,,,,,,,,
c50424,s6,Doesn't have the soul or crowds that Vegas pulls,,,,,,,,
c50424,s7,Really quite disappointing,,,,,,,,
c50425,s1,"After a long flight and ferry across from HK, last thing needed was a 1/2 hr wait to check in",,,,,,,,
c50425,s2,Only 2 staff at the counter ! gave up and wandered off to another part of the hotel and found a SPG only area where check in was swift and efficient,,,,,,,,
c50425,s3,Room was excellent with great views and good amenities,,,,,,,,
c50425,s4,Bed was comfortable Asked for a scissors and that did not arrive throughout my stay,,,,,,,,
c50425,s5,Full of people and looked more like a shopping mall than a hotel,,,,,,,,
c50425,s6,But that is true of all Macau hotels - wandered around the place as a lot of hotels are interconnected,,,,,,,,
c50425,s7,"Venetian , Conrad, Four Seasons all connected and easy to walk",,,,,,,,
c50425,s8,Not sure if all Macau hotels are like this so cannot say how the Sheraton compares but certainly not up to the same standard in service as others I have stayed in_,,,,,,,,
c50426,s1,"Firstly, I arrived at 3pm to check in and there was a super long queue waiting to be checked in, but because I had to watch the Dancing Water show at 5:30pm, I would definitely be late if I waited to check in, so a hotel staff asked me to check in after the show to avoid waiting",,,,,,,,
c50426,s2,"So I came back after the show, and what happened was we requested a room with king bed, but they said they ran out of room and can only offered us a 2xdouble bed bedroom and we were not happy with this arrangement at all",,,,,,,,
c50426,s3,The hotel staff was not helpful and all they said was because they have too many people coming in since its a weekend and all the rooms are occupied and that's what they can only offer us,,,,,,,,
c50426,s4,The room was ok but the toilet towels looked dirty to me,,,,,,,,
c50426,s5,they seem black and old and I didn't_,,,,,,,,
c50427,s1,i try the suit room on club floor this time,,,,,,,,
c50427,s2,totally no luxury feeling inside the room as the materials used inside looks old,,,,,,,,
c50427,s3,the club floor is big that means many people will share the facilities also make me feel no premium added,,,,,,,,
c50427,s4,the location of the club floor also not convenience especially with same floor of the swimming pool,,,,,,,,
c50427,s5,many people wearing the bath robe wondering around,,,,,,,,
c50427,s6,"if i want a comfort relaxing holiday, i wont choose this hotel",,,,,,,,
c50428,s1,I recently stayed at Sheraton  hotel for a birthday getaway which was ruined by an ATM eating my boyfriends bank card,,,,,,,,
c50428,s2,The staff there were not helpful in helping us try and get our card back and never offered to call the ATM phone number for us,,,,,,,,
c50428,s3,Instead they chose to stand around and watch us while they chatted amongst themselves,,,,,,,,
c50428,s4,We then had to go back to our hotel room to make phone calls to our banks to cancel the card in case it did miraculously pop out somehow and someone tried to use it,,,,,,,,
c50428,s5,We made a total of 4 international phone calls totaling 10mins to our bank to cancel the card,,,,,,,,
c50428,s6,Only when we 'express checked out' ( some young lady who was rude and basically shooed us away) we didn't get a receipt or anything to say our checkout was fine,,,,,,,,
c50428,s7,Only to find out a few days_,,,,,,,,
c50429,s1,First time to have to suffer the indignity of queuing 40-50pax deep just to checkin for our room,,,,,,,,
c50429,s2,Something that's not expected of a Sheraton property,,,,,,,,
c50429,s3,Had no idea when we made reservations that this hotel has a casino,,,,,,,,
c50429,s4,Hotel is far away from local shops,,,,,,,,
c50429,s5,"There are no convenience shops, not even a mini mart",,,,,,,,
c50429,s6,You are forced to spend your money within the property,,,,,,,,
c50429,s7,"Macau island is a 30-50 bus ride away (depending on traffic and which service number), rides are fairly cheap, 3",,,,,,,,
c50429,s8,2 to 6,,,,,,,,
c50429,s9,"2 MOP per trip, just look at the machine when you board, it should reflect the fare you have to pay",,,,,,,,
c50429,s10,Make sure you have lots of coins,,,,,,,,
c50429,s11,Rooms are clean and comfortable,,,,,,,,
c50429,s12,Fridge in our room doesn't work,,,,,,,,
c50429,s13,Kudos to the housekeeping staff for a thoughtfully tidied room,,,,,,,,
c50429,s14,Breakfast options are_,,,,,,,,
c50430,s1,It's my second time in this hotel,,,,,,,,
c50430,s2,"As compared to last time, I have noticed that the hotel staff have become significantly less patient and friendly",,,,,,,,
c50430,s3,The shuttle bus drivers shouted at passengers when they insisted boarding the bus even when it's full,,,,,,,,
c50430,s4,"The bell boy at the entrance pointed us the direction to the restaurant with an angry face, without saying a word",,,,,,,,
c50430,s5,These are just two of the examples I experienced in my one night stay,,,,,,,,
c50430,s6,This is my second time in this hotel,,,,,,,,
c50430,s7,"As compared to last time, I noticed that the hotel staff have become significantly less friendly and patient",,,,,,,,
c50430,s8,The shuttle bus driver shouted at passengers when they insisted boarding the bus even when it's full,,,,,,,,
c50430,s9,"The bell boy at the entrance pointed us the direction to the restaurant with an angry face, without_",,,,,,,,
c50431,s1,Arrived via the free Taipa Ferry terminal shuttle bus to see a check in queue with at least 150 people in it,,,,,,,,
c50431,s2,We were moved to a group check in counter (even though there were only 2 of us) and we figured this would be like an express line,,,,,,,,
c50431,s3,It wasn't,,,,,,,,
c50431,s4,"Even with 3 staff on desks and only 2 people in front of us, we waited 45 minutes to reach the counter and then the check in process took about 10 minutes",,,,,,,,
c50431,s5,It was just absurd,,,,,,,,
c50431,s6,It seems this hotel classifies you based on the price you paid for a room,,,,,,,,
c50431,s7,I got an advanced 30% off discounted rate months ago which meant I was allocated a room in the 'Earth Tower' and almost the very last room furthest from the lifts on that particular floor,,,,,,,,
c50431,s8,It was a ridiculously long walk to the entrance and even to the pool,,,,,,,,
c50431,s9,I don't understand why the_,,,,,,,,
c50432,s1,The issue was I entered to a room with welcome amenity that was with another guest name,,,,,,,,
c50432,s2,So i went back to reception and said they gave me a wrong room and asked them to change another room,,,,,,,,
c50432,s3,But then I got a room with strong ciegarette smell,,,,,,,,
c50432,s4,I chose not to go back to reception again since I was so tired,,,,,,,,
c50432,s5,"Upon checkout, I informed the recepionist regarding these",,,,,,,,
c50432,s6,She told me maybe because someone smoked in this room before,,,,,,,,
c50432,s7,"(I understand this is not the fault from the hotel but the housekeeping should make sure room condition before selling to guest) Besides, I told her that no one offered welcome gift upon checkin",,,,,,,,
c50432,s8,I asked if I could get the points now and she said okay (luckily i did ask),,,,,,,,
c50432,s9,She also mentioned no room upgrade for this stay due to high occupancy but will offer_,,,,,,,,
c50433,s1,I spent 1 night from Sunday to Monday at Sheraton Hotel Macau and it was great ! I am not going to complain about the service and the room because everything are fabulous,,,,,,,,
c50433,s2,One thing that I dislike about the hotel is the crowd ! It was my 1st time seeing the queueing line like that with 20 front lines people just to do the check in,,,,,,,,
c50433,s3,I spent about 30 mins just to do the check-in which is unlikely happen when I stay at 5star hotel,,,,,,,,
c50433,s4,"So I guess, Sheraton is one of the most popular hotel among tourist from China and you just need to be ready with the crowd and don't expect to enjoy the swimming pool peacefully either ! Eventho' they have a lot of pools the amount of guest just unbelievable, you can't expect to do swimming properly unless you just want to dip ur feet in the pool",,,,,,,,
c50433,s5,I_,,,,,,,,
c50434,s1,Just concluded our family bonding in Macau and we had satisfactory experience staying @ Sheraton,,,,,,,,
c50434,s2,"Though when we arrived, it's so crowded at the concierge and I'm feeling uneasy already due to the long cue lines waiting for our reservation to be serve",,,,,,,,
c50434,s3,"Good, the room assigned to us was satisfactory to my standard",,,,,,,,
c50434,s4,How I wished that reception area at the lobby were that spacious so as not to be bored while waiting for our room assignment,,,,,,,,
c50434,s5,The hotel lobby were eaten by the casino and since I have kids we me we have no options but to stand and wait,,,,,,,,
c50434,s6,"Good that when we arrived at our room, I felt so relax and at home",,,,,,,,
c50434,s7,Overall passes to my preferred hotel stadard,,,,,,,,
c50435,s1,Conference visitor,,,,,,,,
c50435,s2,"Huge place, i mean HUGE ! I reckon my room was 15 mins fromthe Lobby",,,,,,,,
c50435,s3,"Overall Everything perfectly adequate, if not outstanding",,,,,,,,
c50435,s4,"Two observations : no ' tidy my room' sign, so room service can arrive anytime",,,,,,,,
c50435,s5,"Romm tidy not to European standards - beds and towels, but not much else",,,,,,,,
c50435,s6,"Secondly, the the room safe was  not fixed into the wardrobe, so you could pick up and steal the entire contents ( if you could leave the building)",,,,,,,,
c50435,s7,"Pool very nice, food fine (but pricey)  and i couldn't find a communal lounge bar - which is critical if you are to attract a western audience",,,,,,,,
c50435,s8,Shopping expensive,,,,,,,,
c50436,s1,I arranged a stay at this so called service oriented hotel for my sister as a present,,,,,,,,
c50436,s2,Made online reservation and fully pre-paid with my credit card,,,,,,,,
c50436,s3,"Confirmation received, the usual standard procedure, all good",,,,,,,,
c50436,s4,My sister arrives and is told that unless she can produce the credit card that was used for payment she has to pay again! There goes the gift and surprise out of the window,,,,,,,,
c50436,s5,"True to their mission they have certainly delivered a 'memorable experience', unfortunately the wrong one altogether",,,,,,,,
c50436,s6,As part of the booking they had my e-mail address as well as my mobile number,,,,,,,,
c50436,s7,"In addition the reservation was made in my sisters name and obviously with me paying with my credit card, the name is different",,,,,,,,
c50436,s8,Lots of opportunity for them to address this with me before the stay if the_,,,,,,,,
c50437,s1,"Went in April 2015, disappointed in the room and hotel features",,,,,,,,
c50437,s2,"The swimming pool was disappointing and one side with the jacuzzi was closed, which was secretly open, but the pools were not accessible",,,,,,,,
c50437,s3,"We were dropped with their bus at one side, but had to walk with all our stuff trough the hotel to another counter",,,,,,,,
c50437,s4,Don't get why this was,,,,,,,,
c50437,s5,"since the casino floors are like in the middle, you need to walk around the whole complex to get there if you are with kids, really terrible after a bouncy boat trip from Hong Kong",,,,,,,,
c50437,s6,"To get to the breakfast restaurant we had to walk like 10 minutes every morning, service isnt great",,,,,,,,
c50437,s7,I expected luxury but had to walk that much that I felt we could have better booked in a 4 star smaller hotel,,,,,,,,
c50437,s8,The rooms were OK but compared with other 5_,,,,,,,,
c50438,s1,We were stayed in these hotel for one night,,,,,,,,
c50438,s2,The booking was though the on line agent to reserve with reasonable price,,,,,,,,
c50438,s3,The price was including two breakfast,,,,,,,,
c50438,s4,The lobby was great and a lot of Chinese people walking around,,,,,,,,
c50438,s5,The Reception counter were separate four different areas for check-in,,,,,,,,
c50438,s6,The front desk staffs were helpful,,,,,,,,
c50438,s7,The hotel is separate into two towers,,,,,,,,
c50438,s8,The security guard will cross check in front of the entrance of lift lobby for those suspect people,,,,,,,,
c50438,s9,The room is fantastic but only think the front desk staff cannot put me to non smoking room king size bed,,,,,,,,
c50438,s10,The room is smelly,,,,,,,,
c50438,s11,The check out system is good as you can do by myself in the check out machine,,,,,,,,
c50438,s12,Although we already reserved the breakfasts but they can allow you to choose to take breakfast or lunch buffet,,,,,,,,
c50438,s13,_,,,,,,,,
c50439,s1,"Went there for only one night and while we understand that is really full of people, we were extremely disappointed by the lack of service and food at breakfast! We arrived at 10am! Still 30 mins before they closed the buffet and they had many items gone",,,,,,,,
c50439,s2,"Went to get some eggs and first: the station is just so dirty and disorganised that you don't fancy eating there, and second, the chef, while really polite, couldn't understand what I meant by fried eggs!  Great point: the people at check in were really accommodating!",,,,,,,,
c50440,s1,There are heaps of hotels in Macau,,,,,,,,
c50440,s2,Choosing  Sheraton was a family choice but personally I would not,,,,,,,,
c50440,s3,1,,,,,,,,

c50440,s9,Value for money,,,,,,,,
c50440,s10,? ( only the club floor that is all your meals are there) For my family it's the above 3,,,,,,,,
c50440,s11,This trip we were upgraded to a suite so I should be thankful but the sofa bed that was supposed to be set up was not,,,,,,,,
c50440,s12,This was done after 3 calls and it was past midnight n half an hour later tt they did,,,,,,,,
c50440,s13,Bed springs was protruding,,,,,,,,
c50440,s14,Sigh! Anyway,,,,,,,,
c50440,s15,They give a rollaway the next night,,,,,,,,
c50440,s16,Discomfort settled,,,,,,,,
c50440,s17,Food in the club- amazing,,,,,,,,
c50440,s18,"Almost can be your breakfast, lunch cum dinner all in",,,,,,,,
c50440,s19,Great value for money but alas u will not need to eat any_,,,,,,,,
c50441,s1,Stayed over the weekends with some friends and the service was one of the worst I have ever encountered,,,,,,,,
c50441,s2,"While the hotel looks ok, it was let down by its untrained staff",,,,,,,,
c50441,s3,The checkin took almost half an hour even without a queue,,,,,,,,
c50441,s4,First of all they couldn't find my bookings,,,,,,,,
c50441,s5,"When they have found it after 10mins, the reception asked me if I want to have the rooms that I've booked to be on the same floor, but then proceed to give us rooms on different floors because ""it was busy""",,,,,,,,
c50441,s6,"Finally, the staff said our checkout time could be extended to noon, but when I double checked the next morning, I was told it is 11am",,,,,,,,
c50441,s7,All this and I never heard them apologizing and said a word of sorry,,,,,,,,
c50441,s8,Don't stay here if you want a relaxed holiday,,,,,,,,
c50442,s1,This is my 2nd time staying at this hotel,,,,,,,,
c50442,s2,Had to wait nearly an hour to checkin at the SPG counter,,,,,,,,
c50442,s3,Completely shocking! Realised later its due to slow checkin system,,,,,,,,
c50442,s4,We were also told to 1,,,,,,,,
c50442,s5,5hr for in room food service  Really unacceptable for a 4 star hotel,,,,,,,,
c50442,s6,It felt like Sheranton is under resourced to serve high volume of customers,,,,,,,,
c50442,s7,They do make it up with friendly smiles and initiatives to serve staff,,,,,,,,
c50442,s8,We were there for the pool party at hard rock and were given complimentary water proof pouches! That's exemplary! We also asked for many bottles of water which was promptly delivered to our rooms,,,,,,,,
c50443,s1,We stayed at the club floor,,,,,,,,
c50443,s2,Access to club lounge was great,,,,,,,,
c50443,s3,"Great variety of food and drinks served, although service was not great",,,,,,,,
c50443,s4,Staff were not proactive in serving,,,,,,,,
c50443,s5,We need to ask for plates to be cleared or ask again and again for orders to be taken,,,,,,,,
c50443,s6,Room was small for Macau,,,,,,,,
c50443,s7,I was surprised by the even smaller bathroom,,,,,,,,
c50443,s8,Smallest shower stall I'd ever been in,,,,,,,,
c50443,s9,Service was bad,,,,,,,,
c50443,s10,Reception at the Club lounge on 4th floor was friendly but nothing spectacular,,,,,,,,
c50443,s11,Free welcome drink and cold towel was a nice touch,,,,,,,,
c50443,s12,Didn't even note my husband's birthday after looking at the passports,,,,,,,,
c50443,s13,"Glad that we didn't have to queue at the lobby, it looked extremely busy, almost market like",,,,,,,,
c50443,s14,"When we requested for additional toiletries, had to call twice to remind",,,,,,,,
c50443,s15,When the_,,,,,,,,
c50444,s1,"Positives: Good service from the staff; fairly decent fitness room with free weights, treadmills, cycles and machines; the one-bedroom suite was large with nice views; the rooms were fairly clean; the bed was very comfortable; many English speaking stations on the TV; the included internet was fast and not censored, which means I can check all blogs on my favorite teams",,,,,,,,
c50444,s2,Negatives: It's a casino so you have a lot of people everywhere on the property; long lines at check-in and out; breakfast was plain and not all that good,,,,,,,,
c50445,s1,What we liked:  Good location,,,,,,,,
c50445,s2,#NAME?,,,,,,,,
c50445,s3,You can walk over to city of dreams to catch house of dancing waters,,,,,,,,
c50445,s4,You can easily walk over to the famous Venetian hotel,,,,,,,,
c50445,s5,#NAME?,,,,,,,,
c50445,s6,All hotels around that area seems to provide shuttle buses,,,,,,,,
c50445,s7,What we did not like:  -Strong kind of smell of detergent in the room,,,,,,,,
c50445,s8,"It was not pleasant, what's up with that! -You have to queue for so long to check in even on a weekday, we were quite surprised",,,,,,,,
c50445,s9,"The place itself is damn crowded, we had to queue for 40 minutes",,,,,,,,
c50445,s10,"-Customer service is alright, but unlike other Sheraton hotels we have been to before, everything seems to be done in a rush, but we can't really blame them, they have too many customers",,,,,,,,
c50446,s1,"I stayed here together with my family , 12 of us this time",,,,,,,,
c50446,s2,The experience is disappointing,,,,,,,,
c50446,s3,I am SPG member so we get to stay at higher floor of sky tower whereas my family who booked their rooms via hotel,,,,,,,,
c50446,s4,"com , ended up sending to earth tower which is old and not well maintained",,,,,,,,
c50446,s5,"Not only that ,4 of the room are all in different floors!!   The worst part though , I found the water boiler in my room is completely mouldy",,,,,,,,
c50446,s6,Sheraton in Macau is the worst comparing to any other countries I have been to,,,,,,,,
c50447,s1,Stayed in the family suite which is an awesome size and the kids loved the bunk bed and little extras like kids dressing gowns & slippers etc,,,,,,,,
c50447,s2,"However, no toys or books in the room and only Cartoon Channel available on TV",,,,,,,,
c50447,s3,Kids are too young for playstation,,,,,,,,
c50447,s4,Gorgeous kiddy styled cabanas by the pool but no kids menu for food and drinks,,,,,,,,
c50447,s5,"No kid friendly restaurants either, they all have high chairs but no kids menus or portions",,,,,,,,
c50447,s6,"Swimming pool is basic, no major kid features like slides or anything",,,,,,,,
c50447,s7,Nothing else in the hotel that is super kid friendly other than Shrekfast (highly recommend) or possible shows/activities that you can book and pay for (tried Kung Fu Panda Academy but left early),,,,,,,,
c50447,s8,"Warning on check in and out, takes a min of 20-30mins which is pretty painful when with_",,,,,,,,
c50448,s1,"No way this is a five star hotel, dont have that welcome experience when check in and was told to find the bell boy our self to bring our luggates to our room",,,,,,,,
c50448,s2,There were three of us in a room and only two of each provided,,,,,,,,
c50448,s3,We got drop off at the back entrance,,,,,,,,
c50448,s4,Its along way to the consiege,,,,,,,,
c50449,s1,Macau's 5-star hotels are too busy counting the cash to pick up the telephone's receiver so the wife had to book via the agent,,,,,,,,
c50449,s2,"Yes, agents still exist, albeit only just",,,,,,,,
c50449,s3,The Sheraton it is,,,,,,,,
c50449,s4,She broke it to me gently,,,,,,,,
c50449,s5,"I review hotel chains globally for some part of my meagre living and yes, i am a huge fan of the dying art of hospitality which is why i admire some brands and not all",,,,,,,,
c50449,s6,"Anyway, this is supposed to be about the Sheraton Macau and not about me",,,,,,,,
c50449,s7,"Then again, that is arguable",,,,,,,,
c50449,s8,"I am the Guest (remember what that is?) and were it not for me, hotels wouldn't live",,,,,,,,
c50449,s9,"Anyway, it is a bright sunny day in Hong Kong and the lazy ferry coughs into life as we begin our glide toward's the former Portuguese enclave now a colony of sorts -- owned in huge part by casino moguls_",,,,,,,,
c50450,s1,I am writing this letter to you to bring to your attention a problem I have had with a receptionist name Ann Seridan BarbaI who checked me in during my stay,,,,,,,,
c50450,s2,Allow me to elaborate,,,,,,,,
c50450,s3,I have been heart good name about Sheraton and have always appreciated the excellent customer service Sheraton offer,,,,,,,,
c50450,s4,Yet a recent unpleasant experience at your hotel has shaken my belief in Sheraton ability to provide top notch customer care all the time,,,,,,,,
c50450,s5,"I stayed in room 1-1609 of your Sheraton Macau hotel from June 9th to June 10th, checked in by a non eye contact, non greeting, ice cool receptionist name Ann Seridan BarbaI when 620pm",,,,,,,,
c50450,s6,"When I walk close to reception counter, she was looking at the PC screen (which I hope that my face in on PC screen so that she will be able to looking at me)_",,,,,,,,
c50451,s1,"Queue to checkin like disney land! being the worlds biggest hotel, i had to queue in a lane system much like a large themepark, when i finally got to the clerk, i was asked for a 300 USD depoit, i didnt have credit card or the HKD currecny which they requested, i then had to change USD to HKD at the hotels exchange rate and proceed",,,,,,,,
c50451,s2,"Once my deposit ran out, they cut off all supplies such as Room service, Telephone use and even 2 USD movies in room",,,,,,,,
c50451,s3,"Just a number here, if someone wants 5 star treatment, best go to a smaller hotel which isnt juggling 5000 guests",,,,,,,,
c50452,s1,"Out of the three hotels at coati central, Sheraton Macao is perhaps the least impressive with their rooms",,,,,,,,
c50452,s2,Rooms are generally spacious (so does holiday inn and Conrad) but the decoration is minimal at best,,,,,,,,
c50452,s3,Amenities are adequate but seemingly made cheaply,,,,,,,,
c50452,s4,"Undoubtedly their suites are much better, but given the price paid for, Holiday Inn does a better job than Sheraton",,,,,,,,
c50452,s5,What they lack in their rooms make up with their restaurants and service though,,,,,,,,
c50452,s6,Sheraton has better restaurants (Xin and Bene) than what the other two competing hotels offer,,,,,,,,
c50452,s7,And the service and buffet at the club lounge are quite good,,,,,,,,
c50452,s8,Guests that are SPG members and/or have club access definitely have better service,,,,,,,,
c50452,s9,Would recommend this hotel if it is on a promotion,,,,,,,,
c50453,s1,"In reservation stage,  the staffs were being so helpful",,,,,,,,
c50453,s2,"Reply my enquiry quickly and offer a spa package which includes upgrade to suite,  one way transfer and club lounge benefits etc",,,,,,,,
c50453,s3,All I thought was I could finally find a hotel in Macau that provide good service,,,,,,,,
c50453,s4,My experience was just bad,,,,,,,,
c50453,s5,1,,,,,,,,
c50453,s6,Early check in was accomondate,,,,,,,,
c50453,s7,"But when I check in,  I asked the staff if I can have an air purifier",,,,,,,,
c50453,s8,He said I could call from the room because he doesnt recommend to have the machine on when I am still in the room,,,,,,,,
c50453,s9,"I felt weird with his statement but when I got into the room,  the machine was there",,,,,,,,
c50453,s10,2,,,,,,,,
c50453,s11,"After I enjoyed a relaxing Shine spa,  i was resting in my room",,,,,,,,
c50453,s12,One staff broke into my room without ringing the bell or knock on the door,,,,,,,,
c50453,s13,The manager replied the_,,,,,,,,
c50454,s1,Like any other hotel,,,,,,,,
c50454,s2,Has positives and negatives,,,,,,,,
c50454,s3,Lets start with the positive  The price is excellent for a hotel in this location and services provided   The location is excellent,,,,,,,,
c50454,s4,And the hotel itself has all the amenities you need,,,,,,,,
c50454,s5,Nice casino,,,,,,,,
c50454,s6,The rooms are big and the bathrooms are roomy   The gym is very good and the swimming pool is fantastic   Lets start with the negative,,,,,,,,
c50454,s7,Its really shameful to have such slow Internet in a facility like this,,,,,,,,
c50454,s8,reminded me of the Dial ip Internet Era,,,,,,,,
c50454,s9,although its for free but super slow,,,,,,,,
c50454,s10,had to go to Vanetian mall or Four seasons mall to get a better Internet,,,,,,,,
c50454,s11,The allies on almost all floors smell of wet cloths,,,,,,,,
c50454,s12,The Lifts are hot as if you are in an oven,,,,,,,,
c50454,s13,Probably they forgot to put Air conditioning there,,,,,,,,
c50454,s14,_,,,,,,,,
c50455,s1,It must be quite an adventure to run a hotel,,,,,,,,
c50455,s2,"Many things can go right, many things can go wrong too",,,,,,,,
c50455,s3,"And when things do, the hotel is presented with an opportunity to impress, or in my case, disappoint",,,,,,,,
c50455,s4,My dear wife surprised me with a trip to Macau (my first) with a stay at the Sheraton Cotai,,,,,,,,
c50455,s5,"A lot has been covered by the other 2,568 reviews, and it is easy to write about the good things",,,,,,,,
c50455,s6,"For me, the wifi was faster than expected, though only in the first room (more on this later), the room was spacious and clean, the bed was awesome thanks to its Sealy mattress",,,,,,,,
c50455,s7,"However, one incident marred the whole experience",,,,,,,,
c50455,s8,The power tripped just as my in-room dining appeared on the first night,,,,,,,,
c50455,s9,"The room was plunged in darkness, the air-conditioning disappeared",,,,,,,,
c50455,s10,There was some light_,,,,,,,,
c50456,s1,The room is cozy in a reasonable price,,,,,,,,
c50456,s2,Spend my day mostly in casino,,,,,,,,
c50456,s3,The  Terrible buffet,,,,,,,,
c50456,s4,Feel like the food are already put in there for several days,,,,,,,,
c50456,s5,Food in the food court are not in good quality too,,,,,,,,
c50456,s6,Better just eat outside the hotel,,,,,,,,
c50456,s7,by the way the monitor I order from lounge next to the casino is just terrible terrible teribble,,,,,,,,
c50457,s1,I understand it is a holiday weekend and was not too perturbed by the forty minute wait to check in,,,,,,,,
c50457,s2,"However, when we finally got to the check-in counter, we were told there was no room available even though we had booked and paid months in advance",,,,,,,,
c50457,s3,"After waiting an additional 30 minutes at the counter, we got our room as well as a 30% discount on dinner at The Feast",,,,,,,,
c50457,s4,We head up to our room to find the TV isn't working,,,,,,,,
c50457,s5,We were told to wait and an 'engineer' would be there in fifteen minutes to fix the TV and we should wait in our room,,,,,,,,
c50457,s6,"After two hours of waiting and a few phone calls assuring us someone was on their way, we were told they'd change our rooms",,,,,,,,
c50457,s7,Did they upgrade us for wasting our afternoon? Of course not,,,,,,,,
c50457,s8,"Instead, we were moved to a 'gambling floor' to a room_",,,,,,,,
c50458,s1,"Having spent 2 nights here in 2013 and having had a fantastic time, and also being a SPG member due to the usual excellent Starwood experience, we decided to book the same type of room - the family suite in the sky tower",,,,,,,,
c50458,s2,The drop in quality of the service and our overall experience has been unbelievable for a 5 star hotel,,,,,,,,
c50458,s3,"The worst element is the stench of cigarette smoke on the family floor, which seeps into the rooms",,,,,,,,
c50458,s4,"While smoking is banned and I flagged to staff numerous times that people were smoking on our floor, the only thing that appeared to be done was spraying some deoderiser",,,,,,,,
c50458,s5,it's outrageous that a supposed family floor is so polluted and my kids are exposed to the smoke,,,,,,,,
c50458,s6,We had reserved a suite for 2 adults and 3 kids with an extra bed,,,,,,,,
c50458,s7,We had email confirmation_,,,,,,,,
c50459,s1,My husband and I are staying here with our toddler son,,,,,,,,
c50459,s2,"There are some real positives to this place, but I've felt 'annoyed' too many times during this 3-night trip to give it anything more than an a average review",,,,,,,,
c50459,s3,Let's start with the positives,,,,,,,,
c50459,s4,"Firstly, I was impressed with the room",,,,,,,,
c50459,s5,We're in a good sized suite with 1,,,,,,,,
c50459,s6,"5 bathrooms, and the room is in good condition",,,,,,,,
c50459,s7,This is the place's greatest strength,,,,,,,,
c50459,s8,"I also like the fact that I snagged a good deal on their website (buy 2 nights get one free), so the price was very reasonable",,,,,,,,
c50459,s9,That's another big plus,,,,,,,,
c50459,s10,Now for the frustrations,,,,,,,,
c50459,s11,"To start, I requested a baby cot and non smoking on my booking",,,,,,,,
c50459,s12,"Because I've had enough experience to know that these things get overlooked on bookings, I called the day before departure to check_",,,,,,,,
c50460,s1,"I found it hard to believe that a well known hotel like Sheraton does not carry charger for iPhone! I always thought that it's the little thing that shows you care! Other than that, the room is big and although I chose a smoking room, but I don't feel there's any odour in the room and that's a PLUS!",,,,,,,,
c50461,s1,"Need to line up an hour for check in, staff service was terribly slow and the worst was they even made an error on written down room no to us",,,,,,,,
c50461,s2,When we went up to the room and got failure to go in after trying all room key,,,,,,,,
c50461,s3,"We had to go down to lobby again for checking what wrong happened, the staff just said he wrote wrong no on the envelop of room keys",,,,,,,,
c50461,s4,It is unbelievable this is service from SPG,,,,,,,,
c50461,s5,The even worst was when we went wash room and saw the toilet had not been cleaned,,,,,,,,
c50461,s6,"We had to help house keeping even for flushing, this was the first time of experience we had",,,,,,,,
c50461,s7,"In fact if the hotel is not experience enough to handle so many visitors, they should not promote ss frequent like that",,,,,,,,
c50461,s8,This is just treating !!!!!!!,,,,,,,,
c50462,s1,"Staying more than a hundred nights per year in various hotels around the globe, it is clear that not always things go smoothly and wherever humans are involved problems occure",,,,,,,,
c50462,s2,Nevertheless the experience I made in this hotel was one of the worst which ever happened to me in many years,,,,,,,,
c50462,s3,"Woke up after 3h of sleep due to huge noise of hotel personell in the corridor, caused by laughing, loud talking, shouting",,,,,,,,
c50462,s4,"Roused out of sleep, went out and asked the people politely to please be more silent",,,,,,,,
c50462,s5,"Nothing changed, 30 min more of loud noise",,,,,,,,
c50462,s6,"Went out again, asked them again",,,,,,,,
c50462,s7,"Another hour of the same noise, nothing changed",,,,,,,,
c50462,s8,Called at the guest service,,,,,,,,
c50462,s9,Explanation: police went there to check another guest,,,,,,,,
c50462,s10,"My comment: strangely it was not the police who made that noise, it was the_",,,,,,,,
c50463,s1,We stayed at a club room some time ago and were impressed,,,,,,,,
c50463,s2,"So, we chose to come to this hotel again at club room again to celebrate our child's birthday",,,,,,,,
c50463,s3,We checked in at the club lounge and were asked to pay for my child's use of the lounge,,,,,,,,
c50463,s4,"Fine, they already told me when I requested an extra bed for my child by email",,,,,,,,
c50463,s5,No need so many reminders,,,,,,,,
c50463,s6,We got our room and did not find an extra bed even though we checked in after 5pm,,,,,,,,
c50463,s7,We need to ask again,,,,,,,,
c50463,s8,We went to the lounge for pre- dinner drinks,,,,,,,,
c50463,s9,The dining area was extremely cold and the food  cold too,,,,,,,,
c50463,s10,We could not stay long,,,,,,,,
c50463,s11,"Again, we were asked to sign for my child use of the lounge",,,,,,,,
c50463,s12,"Luckily, we got the extra bed in the evening",,,,,,,,
c50463,s13,A small cake was also sent to our room around 9:30 (isn't it a bit late?) by someone who basically_,,,,,,,,
c50464,s1,Thank you for Sheraton Macau giving me such a 'extremely terrible' experience to enjoy a 5 star  hotel service,,,,,,,,
c50464,s2,I book a room under the name of Ms,,,,,,,,
c50464,s3,Shen in Sheraton Macau at 23rd April,,,,,,,,
c50464,s4,I arrived your hotel around 11:00,,,,,,,,
c50464,s5,I understand that the check in time is at 3pm so i decided to leave the luggage in the concierage,,,,,,,,
c50464,s6,"When I approached concierage desk, one of the concierage associate said he couldn't find my reservation",,,,,,,,
c50464,s7,I am definitely sure I have made the reservation in Sheraton Macau but i don't know why your staff kept challenging and arguing with me said there is no my reservation even I provided them my confirmation number,,,,,,,,
c50464,s8,"And also, he even tell me to settle the problem by myself",,,,,,,,
c50464,s9,imagine if you are coming here for a business trip with only a very short time to take_,,,,,,,,
c50465,s1,Where do I begin,,,,,,,,
c50465,s2,I showed up at 4 to check in with platinum spg in a suite,,,,,,,,
c50465,s3,Room was not available,,,,,,,,
c50465,s4,Humm,,,,,,,,
c50465,s5,Even though check out is 1pm,,,,,,,,
c50465,s6,Okay,,,,,,,,
c50465,s7,Room available at 5,,,,,,,,
c50465,s8,Then I went to a nice concert at the venician,,,,,,,,
c50465,s9,Came back to order room service but no menu in the room,,,,,,,,
c50465,s10,I call to get a menu,,,,,,,,
c50465,s11,A guy came buy 20 minutes later to check there was not a menu in the room,,,,,,,,
c50465,s12,10 minutes later he brought a menu to the room,,,,,,,,
c50465,s13,Then we ordered food abd was told 40 minute wait,,,,,,,,
c50465,s14,Seriously? I ended up eating a bag of pretzels from the mini bar in the executive suite as they have No idea what a basis service means,,,,,,,,
c50465,s15,I will never come back to this hotel,,,,,,,,
c50465,s16,Think twice about coming to this hotel as a platinum member,,,,,,,,
c50466,s1,"I booked a room on 25 Apr for a birthday party, I contact Guest Relations a month ago for the set up and arrangement and everything claimed to be settled even when I was at the check in counter",,,,,,,,
c50466,s2,Well,,,,,,,,
c50466,s3,"when I stepped into my room, nothing was set up, my balloons and flowers were not there as if the communication for the past month was an illusion",,,,,,,,
c50466,s4,"I called and check, they kept saying ""we did the set up, are there really nothing in the room""",,,,,,,,
c50466,s5,Oh come on,,,,,,,,
c50466,s6,"finally after a few calls and some wait time when I was so in a hurry to get the room fixed for the party, they came back to me saying that they did set up the room but it was not the room that they checked me in",,,,,,,,
c50466,s7,"Ridiculous enough?! Alright, so they brought all the stuff back to my room and the party went on",,,,,,,,
c50466,s8,I turned_,,,,,,,,
c50467,s1,"They have too many customers, i cant expect anything",,,,,,,,
c50467,s2,"the worst part is, a male non local staff was very rude to us in the lift! He should explain to us that we couldnt just wear swimming suit in the lift! however, he just closed the door!! Too many people so the pool seems dirty",,,,,,,,
c50467,s3,can hear people talking outside in the room,,,,,,,,
c50467,s4,"i dont think i will go back again, because in macau at this price, i could have alot of better choices!",,,,,,,,
c50468,s1,Came back to the hotel on March 7th for a quick weekend getaway with some good friends,,,,,,,,
c50468,s2,I had recommended this place due to my positive experience last time despite having some hiccups here,,,,,,,,
c50468,s3,"Last time, I thought it was due to the hotel being relatively new, so the staff probably needed some time to get acquainted",,,,,,,,
c50468,s4,"This time, it felt like the quality of staffing was much worse",,,,,,,,
c50468,s5,"For starters, the ""platinum check in"" area was run by inefficient staff - our party checking into 4 rooms on three reservations took the agent over 20 minutes to handle",,,,,,,,
c50468,s6,"Granted, its three different reservations, but I think hotel employees should realize that (platinum) member will be waiting for check in and call in backups to handle",,,,,,,,
c50468,s7,It didn't happen,,,,,,,,
c50468,s8,We decided to have an early breakfast on one of_,,,,,,,,
c50469,s1,"From the beginning, there is a massive queue, worth 20 min, for check in",,,,,,,,
c50469,s2,This is the first time I have experienced this at a good reputed hotel,,,,,,,,
c50469,s3,The room is large and clean,,,,,,,,
c50469,s4,"I was happy to see a recycle bin in the room but seeing how the hotel flaunts its plastic wrapped utilities etc, you can tell that Sheraton is not serious about it's environmental responsibilities",,,,,,,,
c50469,s5,In room dining was a disaster,,,,,,,,
c50469,s6,Ordered some food which I had and threw up 5min after,,,,,,,,
c50469,s7,The meal cost me almost 80usd and I slept sick and hungry,,,,,,,,
c50469,s8,"Next morning put a complaint in, and the staff came in with apologies and a review form",,,,,,,,
c50469,s9,We filled the form and staff promised to get back to me by email about the outcome of the investigation,,,,,,,,
c50469,s10,I doubt they will find anything to jeopardize their own hotel,,,,,,,,
c50469,s11,As a_,,,,,,,,
c50470,s1,Overall good experience,,,,,,,,
c50470,s2,Nice location,,,,,,,,
c50470,s3,inside walking way to casinos of venetian and other hotels,,,,,,,,
c50470,s4,Room was spacious   Buffet breakfast was good menu variety with Indian food also,,,,,,,,
c50470,s5,Shuttle service to fairy terminal,,,,,,,,
c50471,s1,Stayed here for one night for a day trip to Macau,,,,,,,,
c50471,s2,The hotel - was fine,,,,,,,,
c50471,s3,Its much like a large conference hotel,,,,,,,,
c50471,s4,"You can tell by the large hallways, massive rooms and the fact you have to walk about 15 minutes from the elevator to find the pool",,,,,,,,
c50471,s5,"Hotel itself, if you are here to just sun by the pool - is fine",,,,,,,,
c50471,s6,"Its a nice hotel, but its not special",,,,,,,,
c50471,s7,You are one of 2000++ people here who are all very much about themselves,,,,,,,,
c50471,s8,"We used the SPG Club while here, which I am told is the largest in the world",,,,,,,,
c50471,s9,It was PACKED with families with children,,,,,,,,
c50471,s10,Its not relaxing and to try and work here would be a nightmare,,,,,,,,
c50471,s11,They do drinks from 5pm - which must have 300 people at it,,,,,,,,
c50471,s12,"Its a large club yes, but the amount of people who bring their children with them is insane",,,,,,,,
c50471,s13,It really should_,,,,,,,,
c50472,s1,"All hotels in Macau have the gimmicks - Venetian has it's Venice, Grand Lisboa has it's art collection, Wynn has it's tree of prosperity and dragon, and Sheraton has it's Dreamworks",,,,,,,,
c50472,s2,"Can it have a recall factor for it 's guests? For a first time visitor, it is nice to see the characters",,,,,,,,
c50472,s3,We had booked a club room and the club lounge was excellent,,,,,,,,
c50472,s4,The food was excellent and compliments to the chef,,,,,,,,
c50472,s5,Was disappointed that the room showed it's age - the bell sticker was peeling and inspite of staying for 3 days was not repaired or glued,,,,,,,,
c50472,s6,The rooms was not cleaned till 445 pm and had to be called for,,,,,,,,
c50472,s7,"Also,unlike Galaxy the bus connections were limited",,,,,,,,
c50472,s8,I have stayed in many properties but was the first time that the Conceirge charged 1 HkD extra to post a postcard( we had bought_,,,,,,,,
c50473,s1,I received an email from their General Manager on April 9 and the email stated that I reserved a room from April 12 to 13 and I replied I didn't but there was no reply,,,,,,,,
c50473,s2,"Just now, April 13, they sent me another email to ask me to rate their hotel here",,,,,,,,
c50473,s3,"Two years ago while I stayed in this hotel, I was mad by the poor services, no invoice after a month, wrong billings and etc",,,,,,,,
c50473,s4,Now I could only pray they won't charge my credit card or my starwood points,,,,,,,,
c50474,s1,Not the ideal places to stay if you want to visit the cultural side of Macau,,,,,,,,
c50474,s2,"Very generic and uniform rooms, great for a family stay if you would like to spend most of your time at the casino or shopping",,,,,,,,
c50474,s3,"Pool was lovely, nice idea to have choice between lap/spa pools or kids pool (however adults pool closes early)",,,,,,,,
c50474,s4,"Check in was advised to be 3pm, however, was advised that they had over booked and room would not be ready for at least an hour (unless we would accept a twin room over a queen), I was not impressed as I had booked over 5 months ago and was not my problem if they had over booked for the easter period",,,,,,,,
c50474,s5,Free wifi was useful and appreciated,,,,,,,,
c50474,s6,"Due to the size of the hotel, services are quick and dismissive but gets the job done",,,,,,,,
c50474,s7,View of pools and lights of the_,,,,,,,,
c50475,s1,"The Sheraton in Macao has very nice, well equipped and spacious suites",,,,,,,,
c50475,s2,The breakfast buffet in the Club Lounge is rather average,,,,,,,,
c50475,s3,The highest improvement can however be achieved by working on the service attitude of the employees in the Sheraton club,,,,,,,,
c50476,s1,We walked in to checkin counter where one of the front line staff was talking in rudely to one of the hotel guests,,,,,,,,
c50476,s2,"It seemed for me like, the guy was staying in Sheraton as if it were the only hotel",,,,,,,,
c50476,s3,Hotel should train staff on handling guest better,,,,,,,,
c50476,s4,The rooms were nice and clean but nothing special to comment on,,,,,,,,
c50476,s5,The Nepalese security guards in the hotel were very helpful,,,,,,,,
c50476,s6,"If I visit Macau again, I will not choose Sheraton",,,,,,,,
c50477,s1,This is a big hotel with 3000 plus room,,,,,,,,
c50477,s2,"When I check in from the ground floor , I have to wait for an hour ??? Even I am SPG member",,,,,,,,
c50477,s3,It does not help even they have SPG counter there,,,,,,,,
c50477,s4,"Until is my turn check it , she told me to go up to the club lounge for check in ??? Why waited for an hour and told me to proceed another location ??? When I ask them earlier she say is the right place to check in with SPG member",,,,,,,,
c50477,s5,So I get into the line,,,,,,,,
c50477,s6,!! What a crap,,,,,,,,
c50477,s7,Finally I got my suite room and check it,,,,,,,,
c50477,s8,It was more than 2 hours,,,,,,,,
c50477,s9,The room is very new with fresh carpet glue smell,,,,,,,,
c50477,s10,The layout and design is good,,,,,,,,
c50477,s11,One of the best of all other sheraton property,,,,,,,,
c50477,s12,But the service is so bad and they could not control well at all,,,,,,,,
c50477,s13,It had 3 block and most of the guest ms are_,,,,,,,,
c50478,s1,"With 4000 rooms and full occupancy for the Easter weekend, this place wasa heaving",,,,,,,,
c50478,s2,"And being interconnected with the bigger complax that is the Cotai Strip, the largest Sheratobn in the world feels like no other Starwood property",,,,,,,,
c50478,s3,"We took a Club Floor room and, to be honest, you are almost getting an all-inclusive package: all you can eat breakfast and 2 hours of drinks and food in the early evening means that you dont really have to put your hand in your pocket",,,,,,,,
c50478,s4,"Staff were great, transportation from the ferry port was easy, never had to wait long for taxis, this place is great of all you want to do is gawp, gamble or shop",,,,,,,,
c50478,s5,"But, it lacked adequate restaurants unless you wanted the food court or mass production (there is an Italian which, I admit, we didn't try) and there is_",,,,,,,,
c50479,s1,"The Sheraton Macau sits opposite the Venetian, owned by Sands",,,,,,,,
c50479,s2,So it's a good place to stay if u want to be close to the Venetian but not be swamped by the large crowds over there,,,,,,,,
c50479,s3,"The Sheraton is one of three hotels occupying a huge mall development called the Sands Cotai Central, also owned by Sands",,,,,,,,
c50479,s4,The other two hotels are Conrad and the Holiday Inn,,,,,,,,
c50479,s5,"Each of these hotels are not small, each having more than 1000 rooms each, with the Sheraton being the largest of the three",,,,,,,,
c50479,s6,"Price wise, it is cheaper than Conrad but more expensive than the Holiday Inn",,,,,,,,
c50479,s7,It provides two shuttle services,,,,,,,,
c50479,s8,One to the Macau ferry terminal and other to The Galaxy Hotel,,,,,,,,
c50479,s9,"From Galaxy hotel, there are shuttles to other points of interest like the Border",,,,,,,,
c50479,s10,U can also walk about 15 mins to the Tapa_,,,,,,,,
c50480,s1,I arrived at Sheraton with great expectations,,,,,,,,
c50480,s2,Having booked a great deal for their deluxe suite I was really looking forward to the stay,,,,,,,,
c50480,s3,Unfortunately my experience at the SPG counter completely ruined any good feelings of this hotel,,,,,,,,
c50480,s4,I made my way to the separate check in section where I was met with an extremely rude bouncer like attendant surnamed Yang who blocked my entry with a rope,,,,,,,,
c50480,s5,He said check in? Go over there and pointed to the regular check in counter,,,,,,,,
c50480,s6,I told him I was SPG and he actually asked me you are SPG with a very disbelieving tone,,,,,,,,
c50480,s7,I told him yes I am (a second time!) and he asked me to produce my SPG card which I have never received,,,,,,,,
c50480,s8,I said you can check my booking,,,,,,,,
c50480,s9,I don't have my card,,,,,,,,
c50480,s10,"To which he replied this place is full, go to the regular check_",,,,,,,,
c50481,s1,We stayed a this property as we were part of a birthday group,,,,,,,,
c50481,s2,There is nothing intimate or subtle about the property which one would expect from Macau,,,,,,,,
c50481,s3,Thank goodness we are Starwood Gold which made the check in process quick and easy,,,,,,,,
c50481,s4,"We stayed in a suite which was spacious, the decor was standard",,,,,,,,
c50481,s5,"The Club was huge and an awful experience, the food was tasteless",,,,,,,,
c50481,s6,The property is a stones throw from the shopping centre so if you're there for the shopping it's an easy walk,,,,,,,,
c50482,s1,Just stayed 4 Conference days at the Sheraton,,,,,,,,
c50482,s2,Met at Macau ferry and complimentary transfer to Cotai - excellent As a Preferred Guest we were checked in seamlessly and given a great room on 24the floor overlooking pool,,,,,,,,
c50482,s3,"Room size, bed comfort and room features all excellent",,,,,,,,
c50482,s4,The gym and pool areas all excellent,,,,,,,,
c50482,s5,Change facilities all excellent,,,,,,,,
c50482,s6,Our major problem was the value of food and drink to our lower valued Australian dollar,,,,,,,,
c50482,s7,When a hotel coffee shop charges over AUD 40 for coffee and an average tuna sandwich you know that eating at this hotel is going to be a problem,,,,,,,,
c50482,s8,All speciality restaurants are to our budget far too costly,,,,,,,,
c50482,s9,The hotel does have a MacDonald's and a Pacific Coffee venue for that type of product,,,,,,,,
c50482,s10,On the top retail floor of the Sky Tower they have an_,,,,,,,,
c50483,s1,Recently attended an educational conference here,,,,,,,,
c50483,s2,"The hotel has great facilities including the usual amenities, spa, swimming pool, shopping malls galore, plus the expected casino",,,,,,,,
c50483,s3,"However, there is little to do in Macau except for gambling, so if this is not your motive expect to be bored",,,,,,,,
c50483,s4,"With the exception of a very small old town, you will struggle to find the 'real'  Macau amongst of the glitter, tackiness and excessive lights and sparks",,,,,,,,
c50484,s1,Nice large rooms,,,,,,,,
c50484,s2,Housekeeping lacking,,,,,,,,
c50484,s3,"Everything --like with all other hotels on the cotai strip, or indeed all casino-attached hotels, for that matter-- is casino/gambling-oriented and the rest of the services are only secondary: restaurants serve good food but service is abominable, there are no bars, the hotel lounge closes at ungodly early hours,",,,,,,,,
c50484,s4,"Besides the gambling & possible shopping experience, there's nothing that would attract business people in particular",,,,,,,,
c50484,s5,"The friendliness of the staff is also below par, but that is probably to be expected with the millions of guests coming thru the doors",,,,,,,,
c50484,s6,Probably comparable to other cotai strip hotels,,,,,,,,
c50485,s1,I'm not 1st time stay at Sheraton,,,,,,,,
c50485,s2,But I would prefer stay at Conrad in the past due to room and service is better than there,,,,,,,,
c50485,s3,But I and my hubby are also have good stay at this time then will try to come again at next vocations,,,,,,,,
c50485,s4,"Furthermore need to appreciate to Sheraton hotel, they have provide quick check in and out for SPG MEMBER",,,,,,,,
c50485,s5,We're no need spend too much time with the tourist to get out room,,,,,,,,
c50485,s6,thank you!  But we were happen a little thing during our 2nd nite,,,,,,,,
c50485,s7,The staff was overlooked to clean up our room until we back to our room at mid nite to calling up front to clean it up,,,,,,,,
c50485,s8,Hopeless,,,,,,,,
c50486,s1,"In order to make the review easier to deal with, I will split it into several parts: 1",,,,,,,,
c50486,s2,Overall 2,,,,,,,,
c50486,s3,Room 3,,,,,,,,
c50486,s4,Service 4,,,,,,,,
c50486,s5,Food 5,,,,,,,,
c50486,s6,Location  1,,,,,,,,
c50486,s7,Overall impression,,,,,,,,
c50486,s8,"We have decided to book that particular hotel because they gave quite a good offer for the time period we were going to stay, it was roughly 150USD/night with breakfast and ""all-day"" snacks included into the price",,,,,,,,
c50486,s9,"Hotel has a free shuttle bus service from Macau Taipa Ferry, which was particularly convenient for us(we've arrived from Shenzhen, China by boat)",,,,,,,,
c50486,s10,"The bus takes literally 5-10 minutes to get from the ferry to the hotel, which was awesome",,,,,,,,
c50486,s11,"Now, in order to make it fair, I'd have to really clarify things before I go any further",,,,,,,,
c50486,s12,Our trip has taken place right before Lunar(aka Chinese) New Year in February_,,,,,,,,
c50487,s1,"Rooms are nice and very comfortable, but despite being reasonably new there are a few issues - the bath wouldn't plug so wouldn't retain water, a few standard amenities were missing and the entire (non-smoking) floor stunk of cigarettes, even inside the room",,,,,,,,
c50487,s2,"I liked the staff very much, they were very helpful and took care of any issues and requirements",,,,,,,,
c50487,s3,"Used the lounge, the free alcohol was very nice and generously served, the food is not bad but a little variable",,,,,,,,
c50488,s1,Sheraton lives up to its name and its a beautiful property,,,,,,,,
c50488,s2,The rooms are spacious and well laid out,,,,,,,,
c50488,s3,So as far as hotel quality goes full marks to Sheraton,,,,,,,,
c50488,s4,However the staff leaves much to be desired,,,,,,,,
c50488,s5,We took almost 3 HRS to check in(agreed we were a large group but 3 hours is a lot),,,,,,,,
c50488,s6,"The bfast staff was, putting it gently, uncourteous",,,,,,,,
c50488,s7,However the house keeping staff was super,,,,,,,,
c50488,s8,So if u leave aside a few irritants its a super property,,,,,,,,
c50488,s9,They have a heated pool and a good gym and free WiFi,,,,,,,,
c50488,s10,Overall it was a decent experience,,,,,,,,
c50489,s1,We stayed here (3 ppl) for one night,,,,,,,,
c50489,s2,On check in I was told there were only 2 single beds and was not advised these were actually king singles,,,,,,,,
c50489,s3,I explained we were three as per booking and did they expect us to sleep two to one bed and the word single is for one and she said yes,,,,,,,,
c50489,s4,They said I van have another bed at extra cost and after some discussion said it would be free,,,,,,,,
c50489,s5,On arriving in the room I realised it was a king single so cancelled the other bed,,,,,,,,
c50489,s6,Overall as this place is so big with connecting walkways to three other hotels I feel the care you expect of paying what it costs to stay here is lost with so  many people and so a massive place,,,,,,,,
c50489,s7,Would I stay again no,,,,,,,,
c50490,s1,I stayed here for 8 nights,,,,,,,,
c50490,s2,The services was bad,,,,,,,,
c50490,s3,The bedsheets was only changed on the 3rd n 6th day,,,,,,,,
c50490,s4,The bathroom amenities was not daily replenished,,,,,,,,
c50490,s5,The pen n paper was not replenish as well,,,,,,,,
c50490,s6,The slippers was also not replenish as well,,,,,,,,
c50490,s7,The toilet roll given only on alternate days n the what pisses me off was the soap bar n shower n shampoo not given daily,,,,,,,,
c50490,s8,The free water bottle from 4 to 2,,,,,,,,
c50490,s9,I mean i PAY for 8nights but was duly shortchanged by the hotel,,,,,,,,
c50490,s10,To people who going to book this hotel,,,,,,,,
c50490,s11,do remember the hotel is in a shopping center n the human traffic is really horrendous,,,,,,,,
c50490,s12,Chaotic at the checkin n checkout counter,,,,,,,,
c50490,s13,Cos though there is a  que line but jumping que by people is so annoying,,,,,,,,
c50490,s14,Hopeless hotel staff at the reception who dare not stop those que jumping_,,,,,,,,
c50491,s1,Stayed for 2 nights at the executive suite of this hotel,,,,,,,,
c50491,s2,We had stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel on our previous visit but I wanted to earn some SPG points on my loyalty card,,,,,,,,
c50491,s3,Had access to Sheraton's club lounge which is huge compared to the other club lounges I've been to,,,,,,,,
c50491,s4,The breakfast buffet at this club lounge was a full spread and not like the other club lounges where you'd tend to get a very limited buffet spread,,,,,,,,
c50491,s5,"Although it came with free WIFI, the connection was spotty and slow",,,,,,,,
c50491,s6,The location is great for shopping and there are many restaurants at the attached shopping mall,,,,,,,,
c50491,s7,We stayed on the 15th floor and trying a find an elevator that took us to our floor was like trying to play hide and seek,,,,,,,,
c50491,s8,This is a massive hotel and has dedicated elevators to certain floors,,,,,,,,
c50491,s9,_,,,,,,,,
c50492,s1,The hotel is not at the city centre but we knew this,,,,,,,,
c50492,s2,Shuttle bus runs to the city centre from the nearby hotels but there are always many people,,,,,,,,
c50492,s3,Twice we needed to get a taxi which was not expensive,,,,,,,,
c50492,s4,This Sheraton was quite a disappointment considering the standard of service of Starwood hotels,,,,,,,,
c50492,s5,Too too many people that took us long time to check in even at the spg reception,,,,,,,,
c50492,s6,We understand the hotel is big and you expect the number of guests to be huge but they could manage it better,,,,,,,,
c50492,s7,At the reception the personnel was friendly though we could have a better room,,,,,,,,
c50492,s8,We asked if our room was nice and on a high floor and we received a promising reaction from the receptionist,,,,,,,,
c50492,s9,"In the end, we were not on a very high floor and also the view of our room was blocked by the other hotel_",,,,,,,,
c50493,s1,I would rather pay more to stay at other hotel or pay less staying with non-reputable hotel chain which provides professional service to their hotel guests,,,,,,,,
c50493,s2,"Given the reputable Sheraton hotel chain, I have decided to stay 2 nights at Sheraton Macao Hotel, Cotai Central",,,,,,,,
c50493,s3,As a Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG) I received an email from the front office prior to my arrival date,,,,,,,,
c50493,s4,The email consists of check-in instructions for SPG member and I have to reply the email indicating my room preferences,,,,,,,,
c50493,s5,One of the questions asking for bed type and the options are king/twin bed/no preference,,,,,,,,
c50493,s6,I have booked a room for 4 pax and the expected bed setting is 2 twin beds,,,,,,,,
c50493,s7,"Having said so, given the option I replied asking for king bed",,,,,,,,
c50493,s8,"Upon arrival, I went to the express check-in services to_",,,,,,,,
c50494,s1,We booked a room for 2 nights stay here through an airline promotion,,,,,,,,
c50494,s2,Access to property is rather straightforward from the ferry terminal - a free shuttle,,,,,,,,
c50494,s3,"As we were there over the Christmas season, it was full of people and check-in took a bit of time but staff were generally helpful, especially the lady at the Concierge",,,,,,,,
c50494,s4,"She takes time and make an effort to give us directions, map and our options on the ferry sailings",,,,,,,,
c50494,s5,"Food and shops are easily accessible from the Hotel, although this particular one is about 15 mins stroll from the main activity area at The V",,,,,,,,
c50494,s6,"Room-wise, it was on the 28th floor and very spacious",,,,,,,,
c50494,s7,Amenities-wise are what one would expect from a hotel chain of this standard,,,,,,,,
c50494,s8,Good sleep quality with the bed,,,,,,,,
c50494,s9,Did not eat at the hotel so no comments about_,,,,,,,,
c50495,s1,"Traveling with my toddler, we were very tempted by the wonderful kid's activities listed on the hotel website",,,,,,,,
c50495,s2,"Unfortunately, we were greatly misled",,,,,,,,
c50495,s3,NONE of the activities were open during the period we were there,,,,,,,,
c50495,s4,"The tooted heated kid's friendly pool was more like the size of a hot tub, there were so many adults  in the very small area soaking that we were immediately turned off as a hygenique place for toddlers to have fun",,,,,,,,
c50495,s5,"As listed on the hotel website:  ~ ""The hotel offers plenty of children__ activities in the hotel, from cookie decorating, aerobics, and a pool treasure hunt to recycled art making and weekend movie nights on the Sala Pool deck",,,,,,,,
c50495,s6,Our pools and array of recreation facilities guarantee memorable family fun,,,,,,,,
c50495,s7,""" ~   We were excited that Dreamworks have taken_",,,,,,,,
c50496,s1,"It's probably too big - as a result everything is too far away and there are far too many people at check-in, check-out, and everything takes forever",,,,,,,,
c50496,s2,They should have done what Galaxy Casino did and that is to make each of the hotels small so that it is easier to manage,,,,,,,,
c50496,s3,The hotel itself is not bad - rooms are good sized and you see the hallmark of a Sheraton everywhere,,,,,,,,
c50497,s1,"I booked with Sheraton Macau for Dec 30, 2014 - Jan 3, 2015 for New Years with my family",,,,,,,,
c50497,s2,I and my wife also like gambling a bit,,,,,,,,
c50497,s3,We had 6 rooms in all,,,,,,,,
c50497,s4,I always stay in the club floor when I travel for obvious reasons,,,,,,,,
c50497,s5,But I couldn't believe what happened to us in The Sheraton Club Floor,,,,,,,,
c50497,s6,"On our first day, my daughter and her hubby approached a male staff for some information",,,,,,,,
c50497,s7,"When they were in front of him, he simply looked at them and left without a word",,,,,,,,
c50497,s8,"Upon investigation, we learned that he is Joao Collado, Club Floor Manager",,,,,,,,
c50497,s9,"On the second night of our stay, I and another daughter entered the club floor a few minutes before 7pm",,,,,,,,
c50497,s10,"The female staff asked us the usual ""room number pls"" and told us to come in",,,,,,,,
c50497,s11,"However, a man who turns out to be the same Joao Collado blocked_",,,,,,,,
c50498,s1,"This hotel is 1 of 3 hotels, Sheration/Conrad/Holiday Inn, which are part of the Sands Cotai Central mega complex",,,,,,,,
c50498,s2,"I've tried staying for the first time to try to escape the monster crowds at The Venitian, but as it turned out, the experience is not much different",,,,,,,,
c50498,s3,Check-in lines are long as in an airport,,,,,,,,
c50498,s4,"More than 10 minute walk from reception to room, or from room to a restaurant or to anywhere, because this is such a huge complex with endless hallways and corridors",,,,,,,,
c50498,s5,The deco and design average and not as memorable as The Venitian or Wynn Macau or Banyan Tree,,,,,,,,
c50498,s6,"The swimming pools are scattered in to several small pools, instead of 1 big pool",,,,,,,,
c50498,s7,The service is decent,,,,,,,,
c50498,s8,"But lack the personal touches, since this is such a huge huge complex",,,,,,,,
c50498,s9,The shopping center is a grand_,,,,,,,,
c50499,s1,This was my third time I stayed at the Sheraton Macau,,,,,,,,
c50499,s2,"The first time was during its opening, when front-of-house staff was still green to their service",,,,,,,,
c50499,s3,The second time was average,,,,,,,,
c50499,s4,"Yet the third time, which was just after Christmas this year, was really deteriorating",,,,,,,,
c50499,s5,"I had booked a three-day package which included free return jetfoil tickets, breakfast or lunch for two on both days, free lunch for two persons, and MOP400 shopping coupon",,,,,,,,
c50499,s6,"The queue was very long at around 4pm, and my family was greeted by a Mr, Huang",,,,,,,,
c50499,s7,"During check-in, he was always chatting with his colleague on his left side, probably having problems with her guest, and the guest on his right side could not find his reservation and was making a complaint",,,,,,,,
c50499,s8,The whole check-in process took more than 15_,,,,,,,,
c50500,s1,"I had to walk a mile to get to my room, and another mile to the casino",,,,,,,,
c50500,s2,"I wanted to gamble, but all of the ATM machines were out of money so I went to bed",,,,,,,,
c50500,s3,"Arrived today, leaving tomorrow, which is not soon enough",,,,,,,,
c50500,s4,This hotel does not represent the Starwoods brand very well,,,,,,,,
c50500,s5,I think it is designed to serve people who do not know any better,,,,,,,,
c50501,s1,"I had been booked five room night in Sheraton Macau last week, which is SPG Hot Escape rate, prepaid, non-refundable rate",,,,,,,,
c50501,s2,Payment was settled before my stay and confirmed everything is fine,,,,,,,,
c50501,s3,"However, beyond check out, my roommate would like to settle the bill by himself and told the front service agent cencel my payslip and charge his credit card, unbelievable the service agent really do so! I told the agent while check in and confirmed agagain the rate is non-refundable, how come this evidence still happened? And I call their guest commend centre, the service agent there argue with me, told me that I were lack of communication with my roommate! I never expected a five star hotel Gove out this kind of services, and they still argue with me they were right! I completely mad with_",,,,,,,,
c50502,s1,Booked deluxe twin room for our stay,,,,,,,,
c50502,s2,"Besides the usual expected of Sheraton n a very helpful housekeeping staff on duty on 11 & 13 Dec, service of staff whom I encountered was a disappointment",,,,,,,,
c50502,s3,1,,,,,,,,
c50502,s4,Hotel prepared birthday cake for my son which was much appreciated,,,,,,,,
c50502,s5,"However it came without a knife nor candle, not to mention matchsticks",,,,,,,,
c50502,s6,It took an hour before I received all 3 items,,,,,,,,
c50502,s7,2,,,,,,,,
c50502,s8,Housekeeping did not tidy up toiletries at shower area 2 days in a row,,,,,,,,
c50502,s9,3,,,,,,,,
c50502,s10,"SPG checkout area, ramp entrance was closed n I struggled to remove the barrier with staff watching",,,,,,,,
c50502,s11,"At reception, when staff asked for feedback, I related incident but receptionist did not apologize for bad service at all?! No need to say more, the above is not acceptable for the price I paid for a stay at Sheraton",,,,,,,,
c50503,s1,"Normally staying at a Sheraton hotel (or any of its competitors such as Hilton, Marriott, etc",,,,,,,,
c50503,s2,) can prove to be a sublime experience,,,,,,,,
c50503,s3,Everything smells of mildew mixed with basic cleaning fluids,,,,,,,,
c50503,s4,That's exactly how this Sheraton was,,,,,,,,
c50503,s5,"Because Sheraton Cotai is part of the Sands Cotai complex, one would expect it to be much better",,,,,,,,
c50503,s6,But Sheraton proves that reputations do matter,,,,,,,,
c50503,s7,Here is the review,,,,,,,,
c50503,s8,Positives + Absolutely clean room,,,,,,,,
c50503,s9,We had a two-bedroom suite that was kept in clean condition and definitely much better than what we were expecting from Sheraton + We had a suite and the dual bedrooms which were also very well laid out + The hotel's location in Cotai is very close to the Venetian Cotai and features lots of casinos and other entertainment within walking distance +_,,,,,,,,
c50504,s1,This is a nice hotel-we got a good deal and the rooms were large,,,,,,,,
c50504,s2,"But the 3900 rooms means queues:at check in/checkout, at breakfast,at the lift etc",,,,,,,,
c50504,s3,There are queues & crowds everywhere,,,,,,,,
c50504,s4,Its hard to have a memorable experience at such a crowded hotel,,,,,,,,
c50505,s1,"The welcome letter in the room starts with ""welcome to the World's Largest Sheraton (yes each word is Capitalized)",,,,,,,,
c50505,s2,and that's because it's BIG,,,,,,,,
c50505,s3,As you know Macau in a Las Vegas on steroids and this place in no exception to that    Big difference is the Small Service (notice the Capitalization) they offer,,,,,,,,
c50505,s4,Check in is a disaster with long queues (and I am a premium Starwood member) - and if you succeed to find anybody working here - then you have won at the casino,,,,,,,,
c50505,s5,In fact same chances I bet,,,,,,,,
c50505,s6,"Rooms are nice and bathrooms ""plush"", bedding is superb",,,,,,,,
c50505,s7,Call it a 5 star if you want - I give it a 3 and 7/8 and a 1 for service,,,,,,,,
c50505,s8,"Can't tell you if this is a Macau thing or the hotel management style, but in a country where labor is affordable it's a big mistake not to pamper_",,,,,,,,
c50506,s1,"First time in Macau, First time staying in Sheraton Macao Hotel, We arrived at the hotel on a busy weekend in the evening, I will told by my cousin that if I am a SPG member, I can go to SPG front desk for express check in, but the staff there do the check in very slowly, ever ask me to show her the SPG Card, when she can ever check at her system base on my email address",,,,,,,,
c50506,s2,I think if go to the normal check in desk maybe will be faster,,,,,,,,
c50506,s3,"The rooms are clean, huge and well-kept and the room view also very nice(22th Floors)",,,,,,,,
c50506,s4,"The staff who help us to bring our luggage up to the room ever tell us out front that the door is very heavy, when we are opening the door need to be careful not to injure our self",,,,,,,,
c50506,s5,"The In room dining services also quite fast, I call to place an order, they_",,,,,,,,
c50507,s1,Nice hotel coz its just beside the shopping center and i really love the scent of the hotel,,,,,,,,
c50507,s2,The room was simple but sooo comtable,,,,,,,,
c50507,s3,Id like to mention the breakfast,,,,,,,,
c50507,s4,was fantastic,,,,,,,,
c50507,s5,Hoping to stay again here,,,,,,,,
c50508,s1,"The hotel property is good, the food is awesome and the location is great",,,,,,,,
c50508,s2,rooms are spacious and the casino is ok,,,,,,,,
c50508,s3,what needs to be in place for this to be a great hotel is the service attitude of some of the people in the hotel,,,,,,,,
c50508,s4,we were at a conference and just after the break when i asked for coffee i was told that coffee time is over and hence was not served,,,,,,,,
c50508,s5,likewise when asked early before the conference began it was denied,,,,,,,,
c50508,s6,during lunch we asked for something off the buffet menu and were first told that it cannot be ordered and finally after some negotiations got the same and paid extra for it,,,,,,,,
c50508,s7,some lessons on service to be given are needed to make the leap to a great hotel,,,,,,,,
c50509,s1,"I will preface this review by stating that my husband and I are SPG Platinum Ambassador members, which means besides all the benefits that we are entitled to, my husband stays in SPG properties over 100 nights a year!  That's 100/365 nights that our money is spent with the property chain and we were more than disappointed with the service that was offered to us",,,,,,,,
c50509,s2,"Indeed, we have very high expectations, but what is the point of a sticking with a hotel chain if we do not enjoy any benefits?  We left the Sheraton Macau asking this very question",,,,,,,,
c50509,s3,We arrived at the property on a busy weekend (the Grand Prix races were on) and the hotel was supposedly at maximum occupancy,,,,,,,,
c50509,s4,"I understand this is a stressful and busy time for all hotel personnel, but this is also the time big hotels,_",,,,,,,,
c50510,s1,I made the reservation from agency for my trip with Sheraton Macau,,,,,,,,
c50510,s2,The receptionist Agostino assist me for check-in processing and he is really kind and nice,,,,,,,,
c50510,s3,"In addition, he helps me to translate my address with typing to become a member of SPG membership which no need to write anything and feeling like a ""king""",,,,,,,,
c50510,s4,"I requested to stay on the non-smoking floor, but i could discover some smoked cigarettes were being remained near the lift and the surrounding area full of smells",,,,,,,,
c50510,s5,"Thus, I request for change to another floor and another receptionist restricted me to change ""without a wise reason""",,,,,,,,
c50510,s6,Thus I found a hotel manager Mariana to solve the problem and she really had a heart to handle the problem,,,,,,,,
c50510,s7,For the breakfast in Xin is really hard to taste and far away from my hotel_,,,,,,,,
c50511,s1,"All in all a decent hotel with average room and good location as it is connected well to four seasons and the Venetian via the cotai bridge, in room dining was a serious let down specially if you wish to satisfy your craving for Indian food",,,,,,,,
c50511,s2,"It's unbelievable how a hotel like Sheraton Macau can go wrong with a simple dish like lamb biryani, what we indeed got in our room was steamed rice and mutton curry",,,,,,,,
c50511,s3,"I called back in room dining and asked if I could speak to the chef but the lady who picked up my call said this is all that they can serve for biryani and sent a person in 5 minutes to get it picked up with the story ending then and there, a first experience for me in the history of staying with any Starwood brand",,,,,,,,
c50511,s4,They even took 2 calls and 20 minutes to deliver ice cubes_,,,,,,,,
c50512,s1,Arrived very late,,,,,,,,
c50512,s2,Spg gold check in closed then with only two people checking in,,,,,,,,
c50512,s3,get a grip management :( also no one to help with luggage Gave me a suite room upgrade,,,,,,,,
c50512,s4,thanks guys,,,,,,,,
c50512,s5,what a room that is even a KTV room sound proofed in the suite Shocked that there are very very few restaurants and their quality not good Great gym one of best in Asia,,,,,,,,
c50512,s6,:) Casino,,,,,,,,
c50512,s7,no USA style games all Chinese No shows in Macau,,,,,,,,
c50512,s8,Cirque Du soleil canceled due to lack of business Shopping mall next to the hotel,,,,,,,,
c50512,s9,all high end Starbucks 10 mins walk The food court in mall,,,,,,,,
c50512,s10,no western food all Chinese ASK FOR UPGRADE TO SUITE,,,,,,,,
c50512,s11,WOW X 2,,,,,,,,
c50513,s1,"I stayed here for 4 nights for a business trip, 3 nights was paid by the company and I extended one additional night by myself prior to my arranged schedule",,,,,,,,
c50513,s2,"When I checked in, I told the front office that this additional night will be borne by myself, but they insisted that I have to pay for all 4 nights, even they already had a confirmation letter and credit card warranty from the company",,,,,,,,
c50513,s3,"Well, finally they locked up my credit card for $8000 as deposit",,,,,,,,
c50513,s4,"But on the second night, at around 10 PM, the front desk called me and said the deposit was not enough for 4 nights, so I need to come down and swipe again my credit card",,,,,,,,
c50513,s5,what the heck calling at this hour? Then I explained again to her about the condition above and she understood,,,,,,,,
c50513,s6,"My colleague also experienced the same thing,_",,,,,,,,
c50514,s1,I__ stayed in mega hotels in Las Vegas years ago so I suppose I should__e known what to expect from the Sheraton Macau,,,,,,,,
c50514,s2,"They boast that their Cotai Strip hotel is the largest of their chain in the world, but it__ nothing worth bragging about",,,,,,,,
c50514,s3,"Situated in a complex which connects to other hotels, restaurants, a mall and two casinos, the whole feel is cold and money grabbing",,,,,,,,
c50514,s4,"I was told by a stroppy guest service operator that we could only get one extra pillow for our room and drinking water was limited to four free 33ml bottles per day (there__ a plentiful supply of bottles in the free to enter casinos, but you can__ take them with you)",,,,,,,,
c50514,s5,"The bedroom, although bland and generically decorated, was good sized and had two comfortable double beds, plus we had an impressive view_",,,,,,,,
c50515,s1,Free shuttle from the airport and ferry port,,,,,,,,
c50515,s2,New nicely equipped gym was one of the best  on our trip,,,,,,,,
c50515,s3,Nice new room with a comfortable bed,,,,,,,,
c50515,s4,Staff was awkward and the hotel lacked quality food options,,,,,,,,
c50515,s5,I would skip Macao on future trips to Asia,,,,,,,,
c50516,s1,I first visited Sheraton Macao in July / August '13 with 2 friends,,,,,,,,
c50516,s2,"The service was not outstanding and there were minor hiccups such as misinformation in pool availability and shuttle bus routes, but I really enjoyed the Club Lounge for me to book another trip to Sheraton Kuala Lumpur later",,,,,,,,
c50516,s3,I brought my parents back to the hotel on a holiday in October '14,,,,,,,,
c50516,s4,How stark a difference it is from a little over a year ago! I checked in to a supposedly non-smoking room that reeks of cigarette smoke with a door that has a large crack on the side and stained carpets,,,,,,,,
c50516,s5,"Housekeeping happen to be setting up an additional bed in the room and they performed a 'cigarette treatment' which was nothing more than a few sprays of an air freshener, which masked the cigarette smell for an hour or_",,,,,,,,
c50517,s1,We booked a room on non-smoking floor but the room is still filled with sickening smell of smoke,,,,,,,,
c50517,s2,It really ruined my stay in the hotel,,,,,,,,
c50517,s3,"I couldn't get a room change and the only offer I'd got was air-freshener, which basically means further air contamination",,,,,,,,
c50517,s4,I have been to many Macau hotels but this is the first time I encountered such a problem,,,,,,,,
c50517,s5,"I'd seriously choose another hotel next time, honestly, the last thing I want for a vacation is bad air in my room where I plan to sleep and relax in",,,,,,,,
c50518,s1,"Awesome stay at the hotel, all the staff are friendly, especially Luigi of Bene Restaurant",,,,,,,,
c50518,s2,"Unfortunately had very bad and rude experience with the staff of most of  the shopping complex at the sands, cotai",,,,,,,,
c50518,s3,"Also the taxi drivers and also the people of PRC, so dirty and like to spit everywhere, even in lift",,,,,,,,
c50518,s4,"And you will get scolded for asking a direction from the locals!  Honestly, I do not recommend Macao a good place for vacation",,,,,,,,
c50519,s1,I was there about a week ago,,,,,,,,
c50519,s2,Room was great & clean,,,,,,,,
c50519,s3,The bed is so comfortable,,,,,,,,
c50519,s4,Location is great,,,,,,,,
c50519,s5,"Service staffs are very polite, friendly & helpful from entrance > reception > housekeeping > restaurant > pool",,,,,,,,
c50519,s6,We booked a table for 9 pax in the Feast restaurant,,,,,,,,
c50519,s7,Ambiance was nice,,,,,,,,
c50519,s8,The waiter that served us is polite & humble,,,,,,,,
c50519,s9,Thumbs up,,,,,,,,
c50519,s10,But there are few negative things I need to bring up to your attentions: 1,,,,,,,,
c50519,s11,"At 2000hrs, restaurant is running out of teaspoon(obviously not the waiter's fault)",,,,,,,,
c50519,s12,We ended up using chopstick to stir our coffee & tea,,,,,,,,
c50519,s13,2,,,,,,,,
c50519,s14,I have no words to describe the satay,,,,,,,,
c50519,s15,It just don't taste like satay,,,,,,,,
c50519,s16,3,,,,,,,,
c50519,s17,"Lastly, near the dessert counter area",,,,,,,,
c50519,s18,There are 2 chefs and a gentleman in jacket(I am sure he is the staff there as I can see there is a Sheraton pin_,,,,,,,,
c50520,s1,"Yes, there are black sheeps everywhere, and yes, it could ruin your entire stay just when you thought it could almost be a ""perfect"" stay",,,,,,,,
c50520,s2,"The entire experience, to share for awareness",,,,,,,,
c50520,s3,End to end,,,,,,,,
c50520,s4,Check in: The standards of check-in staff were consistently patience and attentive on our return trip,,,,,,,,
c50520,s5,The abilty to understand conversational english were primarily dependent on the middle supervisors and managerial level,,,,,,,,
c50520,s6,Expect some delays during check-in if you are in the rush to get in and move on with your itineraries,,,,,,,,
c50520,s7,We were offered an upgrade to executive suite,,,,,,,,
c50520,s8,An attempt to accomodate room preferrence at its best,,,,,,,,
c50520,s9,A wow factor from the front desk team,,,,,,,,
c50520,s10,Good job to Joyce,,,,,,,,
c50520,s11,In Room: The conditions of the suite were really clean and in order,,,,,,,,
c50520,s12,"However, the metal rack_",,,,,,,,
c50521,s1,General room decos but new,,,,,,,,
c50521,s2,Super busy concourse because it is on the main aisle of casino!,,,,,,,,
c50522,s1,It takes a while to realize there are 3 hotels embedded in two good size casinos,,,,,,,,
c50522,s2,Maps are hard to decode,,,,,,,,
c50522,s3,Bus from the Turbojet ferry to hotel is a adventure,,,,,,,,
c50522,s4,There are two ferry docks on the way back,,,,,,,,
c50522,s5,Employees at the hotel referred us to three different lobbies to catch the one back,,,,,,,,
c50522,s6,Inbound bus takes you to a Sands complex on another island,,,,,,,,
c50522,s7,You need to figure out that there is another bus (of many) to get in line to go to the Cotai complex where you wander around to find the right lobby,,,,,,,,
c50522,s8,Service was great and room was alo,,,,,,,,
c50522,s9,Buffet in am is a bummer,,,,,,,,
c50522,s10,Go to a McDonalds,,,,,,,,
c50523,s1,We went in March to see the Rolling Stones,,,,,,,,
c50523,s2,"The hotel was fine, the room was a twin and perfectly big enough",,,,,,,,
c50523,s3,"Nothing exciting or amazing, but nothing wrong with it either",,,,,,,,
c50523,s4,"There are other I think better hotels nearby, but probably more expensive",,,,,,,,
c50523,s5,The Sheraton is above its own casino and sort of melds into a shopping mall which has some restaurants and a mix of luxury and mid level shops and then turns into another big hotel,,,,,,,,
c50523,s6,"Amazingly (to us) there was no proper bar, we were pointed to the empty lobby cafe which has a few bottles of alcohol",,,,,,,,
c50523,s7,So the concierge sent us over to the bar in the casino of the Venetian - connected by a covered bridge from the shopping mall,,,,,,,,
c50523,s8,"And he was right, the casino and the bar were much livelier over there and in fact the bar had a really good DJ_",,,,,,,,
c50524,s1,Horrible service and horrible experience,,,,,,,,
c50524,s2,"Place is like a railway station Pool area has no food, no fruit juices, no cocktails and doesnt even serve Pizza",,,,,,,,
c50524,s3,"I guess if you are the kind that looks for dimsum by the poolside, u wont be disappointed",,,,,,,,
c50524,s4,Very few english speaking staff and so in-room dining is an experience in itself,,,,,,,,
c50524,s5,Lifts are very overcrowded and offers a monday morning experience in a crowded office lift lobby,,,,,,,,
c50524,s6,Will NEVER stay at a Sheraton again,,,,,,,,
c50525,s1,Firstly I would like to stress that the quality of accommodation and facilities in this hotel is 5 star - it cannot be faulted and I was impressed,,,,,,,,
c50525,s2,What really put me off were perhaps expectations I have become accustomed to in the West - hence I wanted to caveat this before my review,,,,,,,,
c50525,s3,"Whilst we chose non-smoking area of the hotel, it was quite clear that this was not observed by guests, nor was it enforced by hotel staff",,,,,,,,
c50525,s4,"During our stay, we often saw people smoking, without discretion, throughout the 'non smoking' section of the hotel",,,,,,,,
c50525,s5,in addition our non-smoking room smelled of smoke and we actually saw guests in the neighboring room smoking away whilst their door was ajar,,,,,,,,
c50525,s6,Indoor smoking is generally in the norm in Asia and something I am not used to with my family_,,,,,,,,
c50526,s1,"Location:  at the end of Cotai strip, currently it is a bit off",,,,,,,,
c50526,s2,"A typical casino hotel connected with a mall, many average dining outlet, connected to a Holiday Inn",,,,,,,,
c50526,s3,within 10 mins walk to City of Dream,,,,,,,,
c50526,s4,"Like other Macao Casino hotel,  Complimentary shuttle bus line to Ferry/Airport/Galaxy/Border",,,,,,,,
c50526,s5,"A pity, there should be a line to Macao oldtown (city)/  Service:  The service at the 4th Floor Club lounge was excellent, yet the arrangement at the SPG  dedicated counters on Main Lobby was chaotic",,,,,,,,
c50526,s6,"We booked the Club room, yet the Sheraton Club lounge is a bit of walk from the lift foyer of Sky Tower on 4th floor",,,,,,,,
c50526,s7,"We hated the walk, so we checked out on lobby floor SPG area",,,,,,,,
c50526,s8,There should be two lines or counter check-in and check out instead of one line since service was_,,,,,,,,
c50527,s1,"First the positive: Very nice swimming pools, pretty good food and a couple of very helpful bell boys",,,,,,,,
c50527,s2,I would not go to this hotel again for some other reasons,,,,,,,,
c50527,s3,The hotel is huge and shiny but it seems that the got the air-conditioning a bit off with the result that the hotel is damp and smells musty,,,,,,,,
c50527,s4,We noticed that the corridors have no air vents or very few - making it a very sweaty and smelly walk to and from the guest rooms,,,,,,,,
c50527,s5,"Moreover, the staff either does not understand simple English and sign language, or just does not care",,,,,,,,
c50527,s6,"Most of the time, they were indifferent to the point of being rude",,,,,,,,
c50527,s7,"Check in and check out is a drab, dreary, slow affair and we missed our bus to the ferry in spite of having almost 30 minutes to spare",,,,,,,,
c50527,s8,"It ended well though, there was one very_",,,,,,,,
c50528,s1,I stayed there for our 7th anniversary with my love for 2 nights,,,,,,,,
c50528,s2,Thanks hotel gave free chocolate and had a little decoration on the bed,,,,,,,,
c50528,s3,But I have a little bit disappointed,,,,,,,,
c50528,s4,1,,,,,,,,
c50528,s5,"When we arrive the check in counter, a junior staff is with smile, but the senior staff is no smile and seems impolite (who stand behind the junior and helping the junior for our check in )",,,,,,,,
c50528,s6,2,,,,,,,,
c50528,s7,"When we first come inside the room, few dirty and used pens are on the floor",,,,,,,,
c50528,s8,3,,,,,,,,
c50528,s9,There is no comb in the toilet,,,,,,,,
c50528,s10,I have to take it from 4/F changing room,,,,,,,,
c50528,s11,4,,,,,,,,
c50528,s12,"When I want to leave some opinion on the hotel opinion card , I found that that card is used and there is guest's information like telephone no",,,,,,,,
c50528,s13,"Last month I just stayed in Conrad Macau, their service is really very good",,,,,,,,
c50528,s14,I stayed in Sheraton Macau for few_,,,,,,,,
c50529,s1,Booked a junior suite via Starwood SPG website,,,,,,,,
c50529,s2,Chose this hotel because it was the cheapest upscale international hotel in the Cotai area,,,,,,,,
c50529,s3,"By the number of guests rooms, it is also the biggest Sheraton brand hotel in China, perhaps in Asia",,,,,,,,
c50529,s4,In-room decor is acceptable considering the cheap tariff,,,,,,,,
c50529,s5,Pictures attached,,,,,,,,
c50529,s6,"The service at Sheraton Macau is exceedingly impersonal, if not degrading",,,,,,,,
c50529,s7,It is the worst of all Sheraton or SPG group of hotels I have stayed in China,,,,,,,,
c50529,s8,1) No bell boy at lobby to assist with luggage into and checking out of the hotel,,,,,,,,
c50529,s9,2) First time I have been told at an upscale hotel that towels has to be exchanged instead of extra towels being provided,,,,,,,,
c50529,s10,This is insulting for myself who neither steal nor have the need to steal,,,,,,,,
c50529,s11,If Sheraton is_,,,,,,,,
c50530,s1,Stayed one night at Sheraton Macao due to the hotel next door was fully booked,,,,,,,,
c50530,s2,"Since this hotel has over 3,000 rooms/suites, we had to be in a long queue upon check-in in hotel lobby",,,,,,,,
c50530,s3,"Maybe we booked through online booking agent or we were the first timer of this hotel, we couldn't see or feel a warm welcome at all",,,,,,,,
c50530,s4,"With 2 separate towers, i",,,,,,,,
c50530,s5,e,,,,,,,,
c50530,s6,"Sky Tower & Earth Tower in Sands Cotai Central Complex, the Front Desk Officer didn't remind us which way we should approach while they gave us the room keys, and we just realized we went to the wrong tower until the advice by security officer at lift lobby",,,,,,,,
c50530,s7,"The room is just enough for 2 persons, and no space for an extra bed",,,,,,,,
c50530,s8,Don't expect any turndown service in the evening,,,,,,,,
c50530,s9,Though the hotel states that they provide free WIFI_,,,,,,,,
c50531,s1,"There is nothing wrong with this hotel, but there is also nothing exceptional about it either",,,,,,,,
c50531,s2,The staff was friendly - after we resolved the disaster at check in,,,,,,,,
c50531,s3,The room was a nice size - I had 2 doubles,,,,,,,,
c50531,s4,And the bathroom was  a very nice size wtih a good shower,,,,,,,,
c50531,s5,"The location is not really in Macau proper - it is in the new part of town in Cotai, which is fine - just takes longer to get to when coming in from the Ferry",,,,,,,,
c50531,s6,"All in all, I had a fine stay",,,,,,,,
c50531,s7,"there is just nothing that really stands out about it and if you are in Macau, you want to be wowed!!",,,,,,,,
c50532,s1,Travelled from HK for weekend in Macau and stayed at the Sheraton on the Cotai strip,,,,,,,,
c50532,s2,We were in a family suite which was spacious and suited our family,,,,,,,,
c50532,s3,The focus of our weekend was to relax by the pool and around the hotel,,,,,,,,
c50532,s4,Unfortunately we found staff customer service to be quite inconsistent and raised concerns with a very professional Duty Manager in Reception during our stay,,,,,,,,
c50532,s5,"However, this is a higher end hotel and some of the following inconsistencies are not satisfactory",,,,,,,,
c50532,s6,Our experiences with inconsistencies in customer service started with the 'guest relations' staff on the phone once we had checked in and were in our room,,,,,,,,
c50532,s7,There seemed to be a language barrier when the call was made to 'guest relations'  and our problem was not understood,,,,,,,,
c50532,s8,It took several phone_,,,,,,,,
c50533,s1,"Scanning the reviews of this hotel, you will expect luxury and a quality of furnishings and service that are common of the Sheraton and Westin chain of facilities",,,,,,,,
c50533,s2,Our experience of Macau Cotai is no exception to these opinions but with the major exception that we considered even these attributes to be unacceptably expensive,,,,,,,,
c50533,s3,"The fact that this also applies to the surrounding hotels, is no excuse",,,,,,,,
c50533,s4,Macau Cotai is in our opinion overpriced for what it offers,,,,,,,,
c50533,s5,"Certainly this is an exaggerated offering of all types and the thrill of the gambling casinos within this complex of huge hotels with all they have to offer is startling, dazzling and entertaining",,,,,,,,
c50533,s6,"If that is what you want to pay so much for, then you have hit the bulls-eye",,,,,,,,
c50533,s7,"If you are more discerning and less demanding, then_",,,,,,,,
c50534,s1,a colleague booked two rooms for us for a work trip,,,,,,,,
c50534,s2,on arrival i couldnt check in as they needed my colleagues passport as he had made the booking,,,,,,,,
c50534,s3,so i had to wait three hours for my room as we had flown in at different times,,,,,,,,
c50534,s4,not too bad for me i had only flown several hours from bangkok but if you had travelled a long way this would be the last thing you need,,,,,,,,
c50534,s5,check in was friendly and very helpful when i was allowed to check in,,,,,,,,
c50534,s6,room was very nice and very well equipped,,,,,,,,
c50534,s7,"view was nothing special, i could see the excellent swimming pools but the other half of my view is all the air conditioning equipment for the hotel",,,,,,,,
c50534,s8,"i ordered room service first night and ordered the ""pork bun"" this was one of the worst room service  meals i had ever received",,,,,,,,
c50534,s9,it literally was a piece of_,,,,,,,,
c50535,s1,There is reason why this hotel is Cheaper than other 5 stars hotel in Macau,,,,,,,,
c50535,s2,Chose this hotel just because of the breakfast for my kids,,,,,,,,
c50535,s3,And you can walk to the'Water show' hotel in 5 mins,,,,,,,,
c50535,s4,Room is big but decoration is cheap,,,,,,,,
c50535,s5,Expect to see lots of guest from China,,,,,,,,
c50535,s6,One good point of this hotel is the Italian restaurant there is great,,,,,,,,
c50535,s7,But for dining there you dont need to stay in the hotel,,,,,,,,
c50536,s1,__ Check in ___________ Quick and smooth check in,,,,,,,,
c50536,s2,Nice staff,,,,,,,,
c50536,s3,__ cleanness ___________________________________________ Most of the equipment is clean and tidy,,,,,,,,
c50536,s4,But the room is smelly of peel,,,,,,,,
c50536,s5,This is completely not acceptable  _ Facilities ______________________________________________________ There are many pools with both cool and warm waters,,,,,,,,
c50536,s6,But the pool was too small,,,,,,,,
c50536,s7,The staff did not handle the children s who was running around and jumping into the water,,,,,,,,
c50536,s8,These made the pool very danger and we can't relax at the pool,,,,,,,,
c50536,s9,____ Special arrangement _______________________________________________________________________________________________ I've send a email to the hotel and they had arranged a mini birthday cake for my two years old boy,,,,,,,,
c50536,s10,"However,_",,,,,,,,
c50537,s1,I am a spg member and usually choose Sheraton for my business/leisure trips,,,,,,,,
c50537,s2,I have stayed in this Sheraton several times before but this experience was the most disappointing,,,,,,,,
c50537,s3,the short version is: when I asked for an extra bath towel over the phone I was told by two different persons in housekeeping that they could only exchange bath towels and could not give me an extra one,,,,,,,,
c50537,s4,I find this truly ridiculous and in fact having stayed in hotels all over the world  this is the first time ever such happened to me,,,,,,,,
c50537,s5,"I assumed this policy was there to prevent people asking for extra towels and taking them away (""stealing"" was the word)",,,,,,,,
c50537,s6,"the point being, the hotel had my credit card record for incidentals (as well as breakages and/or anything missing/stolen from the room)",,,,,,,,
c50537,s7,this_,,,,,,,,
c50538,s1,I spent 5 nights this month in a work trip that was held at the Sheraton Macau,,,,,,,,
c50538,s2,I was looking forward to the trip despite not being a gambler myself,,,,,,,,
c50538,s3,"However this monstrous hotel, which has apparently over 3,000 rooms, was a real let down",,,,,,,,
c50538,s4,Room quality was poor although the room was huge,,,,,,,,
c50538,s5,"The fittings and bathrooms were luxurious in about 1990 but dated and poor now, although the bed was comfortable",,,,,,,,
c50538,s6,"Worst of all, every available square inch of the common areas is given over to gambling",,,,,,,,
c50538,s7,"There is no nice bar or decent coffee shop, apart from a hopelessly inadequate one on the ground floor which is constantly full of families apparently waiting for the gambler to come out of the casino, for hours at a time",,,,,,,,
c50538,s8,"The staff show zero care or interest in you, and take no action to stop_",,,,,,,,
c50539,s1,"We visit Macau several times a year and usually stay at the Galaxy, Holiday Inn Cotai Central or Galaxy",,,,,,,,
c50539,s2,"Based on rather nice photos and many positive reviews of the Sheraton Cotai, we decided to stay here and ended up disappointed",,,,,,,,
c50539,s3,"Having stayed at the Venetian which is spread over a larger area than the Sheraton, we were not overwhelmed by the size",,,,,,,,
c50539,s4,The deluxe room is smaller than the TA photos would lead one to believe and lacking in character (see photos posted separately),,,,,,,,
c50539,s5,The Holiday Inn Cotai has nicer and more inviting rooms than the drab and dull color theme of the Sheraton's deluxe rooms,,,,,,,,
c50539,s6,Just spend a Sunday night here if you want to experience the world's biggest Sheraton; it is not worth paying the marked up rates on Fridays and Saturdays,,,,,,,,
c50539,s7,The room attendants will_,,,,,,,,
c50540,s1,This is a massive hotel with a massive mall and massive casino on massive Cotai strip,,,,,,,,
c50540,s2,Vulgar would be rather fitting,,,,,,,,
c50540,s3,There are about 3 million people in the mall and around the hotel lobby,,,,,,,,
c50540,s4,"Once you get the elevator up to your room, it's another world",,,,,,,,
c50540,s5,"Peace, tranquility",,,,,,,,
c50540,s6,But alas my room had a nice view of the building site next door,,,,,,,,
c50540,s7,Another hotel no doubt,,,,,,,,
c50540,s8,The highlight of my stay was the queue outside and opposite the lobby for the taxis,,,,,,,,
c50540,s9,It took 45 minutes to get one,,,,,,,,
c50540,s10,The taxi situation in Macau is a major headache,,,,,,,,
c50540,s11,There are far too many visitors for the infrastructure to support,,,,,,,,
c50540,s12,This isn't a Sheraton,,,,,,,,
c50540,s13,It's way too much below par to deserve the name,,,,,,,,
c50541,s1,"This hotel is huge and you can get lost easily!  Like all other Sheratons, there is really nothing special about the rooms",,,,,,,,
c50541,s2,It looks like any other Sheraton room in the world,,,,,,,,
c50541,s3,"It was comfortable, decent, and but not really any wow-factor_ which was okay because I am very familiar with the Sheraton brand",,,,,,,,
c50541,s4,My biggest gripe is the ELEVATOR SYSTEM!  This hotel has the most confusing elevators in the world,,,,,,,,
c50541,s5,"Only certain elevators will go to certain floors, and I guarantee you will go in the wrong elevator at least once",,,,,,,,
c50541,s6,The signs are not really visible in which elevators to take which adds to the confusions,,,,,,,,
c50541,s7,There was also a lack of dining variety at this huge hotel,,,,,,,,
c50541,s8,"There is an Italian restaurant, but other than I believe all the other 10 restaurants are Chinese",,,,,,,,
c50541,s9,The food_,,,,,,,,
c50542,s1,"After a night of a dinner, show and other fun I went back to my room",,,,,,,,
c50542,s2,While trying to fall asleep late a night there were many young kids running around the hallway,,,,,,,,
c50542,s3,I think the parents left them in the room while they were down stairs gambling,,,,,,,,
c50542,s4,These kids sounded like a heard of elephants and were screaming their heads off,,,,,,,,
c50542,s5,I called guest services to complain and they said they would take care of it,,,,,,,,
c50542,s6,They did not do what they said and did not send anyone,,,,,,,,
c50542,s7,The noise continued for 30 more minutes,,,,,,,,
c50542,s8,I called again and they told me I could move to another room,,,,,,,,
c50542,s9,ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!  Instead of taking care of the issue they wanted the me to move my room at 1 AM in the morning,,,,,,,,
c50542,s10,Completely ridiculous and horrible customer service,,,,,,,,
c50542,s11,Other than terrible customer service,,,,,,,,
c50542,s12,The_,,,,,,,,
c50543,s1,Not my normal hotel in Macau - thought I would give it a go,,,,,,,,
c50543,s2,Definitely will not be back,,,,,,,,
c50543,s3,"Not impressed at all, arrived around 8pm, 5 people behind the desk and only 2 actually serving the queue",,,,,,,,
c50543,s4,Check in was a hassle then the long walk to the elevators through a throng of shopping and gambling crowds,,,,,,,,
c50543,s5,"Room was okay, I found service culture completely lacking and scale of the hotel makes everything chaotic",,,,,,,,
c50543,s6,Looked for somewhere to eat on my own and gave up - myriad of faceless buffets,,,,,,,,
c50543,s7,Eventually went to another hotel and ate there,,,,,,,,
c50543,s8,Booked a club room so had breakfast the next morning in the club,,,,,,,,
c50543,s9,"Didn't get coffee, none offered and no service",,,,,,,,
c50543,s10,"Went to check-out at the ""exclusive for club members"" check out in the Club reception",,,,,,,,
c50543,s11,It was so exclusive there was no one_,,,,,,,,
c50544,s1,Friends of 4 ladies booked two twin rooms for one night in Sheraton Macau on 18 Aug 2014,,,,,,,,
c50544,s2,The check-in time was 3:00 and we arrived at 4:00,,,,,,,,
c50544,s3,"Wow! ""No twin room right now",,,,,,,,
c50544,s4,You have to wait,,,,,,,,
c50544,s5,""" How long then? ""Not sure, right now there are 78 rooms to clean",,,,,,,,
c50544,s6,oh now 124 rooms,,,,,,,,
c50544,s7,You have to wait,,,,,,,,
c50544,s8,""" What should we do? ""You have to wait",,,,,,,,
c50544,s9,It may take a long time,,,,,,,,
c50544,s10,""" After we complained and complained, the attendant offered an upgrade of room with a double",,,,,,,,
c50544,s11,"We didn't ask for an upgrade, we need a standard twin room! Then the attendant offered a temporary double room for us so that we could go to swim and wait for a twin room",,,,,,,,
c50544,s12,She promised to call one of us when the room were ready,,,,,,,,
c50544,s13,Then we changed swimming suits and left our luggages in the room,,,,,,,,
c50544,s14,We received her call after we got out of_,,,,,,,,
c50545,s1,I did look through the reviews before i made the reservation,,,,,,,,
c50545,s2,"nevertheless, i thought i lost when i was led to the lobby for check in on the day of arrival",,,,,,,,
c50545,s3,the reception counter is hidden at one of the corner of the lobby which is luxuriously decorated,,,,,,,,
c50545,s4,you felt like you are walking into a casino or shopping malls,,,,,,,,
c50545,s5,receptionist were polite but they tend to speak in mandarin,,,,,,,,
c50545,s6,the key card even have a map attached so that customer wont get lost n the hotel itself,,,,,,,,
c50545,s7,"among the hotels in cotai strips, it is very conveniently situated and the popular attractions such as Venetian is very nearby",,,,,,,,
c50545,s8,you can just take the linked bridge and Venetian is just walking distance from Sheratan,,,,,,,,
c50545,s9,another good things is the hotel has a big shopping mall in it and there are a lot of branded shops such_,,,,,,,,
c50546,s1,If Henry Ford was alive and if he was a htelier this would be his Casino/Hotel,,,,,,,,
c50546,s2,"I hated the moment we step in, it had no personality, its looked like a Mainland poor hotel trying to be westernized, but the lack of everything i expected in hotel made my experience in Macau a terrible terrible moment in my trip",,,,,,,,
c50546,s3,Sheraton should be ashamed of adding this mocking of a hotel in their portfolio,,,,,,,,
c50546,s4,It is my 2nd disappointment in the Sheraton franchise,,,,,,,,
c50546,s5,Positive: The shopping mall during the day attached to the hotel is full of shops and with a lot of choices of restaurants and retail stores,,,,,,,,
c50546,s6,Negative: First indian queue i ever seen in a hotel it just so crowded that they need a controller,,,,,,,,
c50546,s7,It looked like we arrived to some sort of public service,,,,,,,,
c50546,s8,"The rooms, for a new hotel it was_",,,,,,,,
c50547,s1,Tried to book 2 nights from spg website but no avail,,,,,,,,
c50547,s2,Found rooms via agoda,,,,,,,,
c50547,s3,com and reserved a dlx w bfast pkg,,,,,,,,
c50547,s4,Check in~ being an spg gold,,,,,,,,
c50547,s5,I quered at the designated line,,,,,,,,
c50547,s6,Check in was fast but unfortunately i was told i am not entitled to any gold benefit since i did not booked direct from their spg website,,,,,,,,
c50547,s7,I explained the no room situation but no help,,,,,,,,
c50547,s8,Was assigned to a non spg member floor on 18th floor neaabu elevator,,,,,,,,
c50547,s9,I called to speak to one of the supervisor,,,,,,,,
c50547,s10,Mavis,,,,,,,,
c50547,s11,She told me basically the same thing about nor being eligble for spg benefit,,,,,,,,
c50547,s12,i phoned to request for an extra duvet,,,,,,,,
c50547,s13,Was told by mavis the hotel is so full not even one extra duvet is available!! 7pm ~the corridor on 18fl was full of kids crying  parent screaming so i had to call Mavis again to request a_,,,,,,,,
c50548,s1,Stayed two nights at this hotel only because I had to see a show in the nearby City of Dreams complex,,,,,,,,
c50548,s2,"Well, the hotel property is modern and clean, but apart of that there is nothing to commend about",,,,,,,,
c50548,s3,"The room is basic, even the toiletries are basic and no touch of luxury whatsoever, even so it commands a US$250 per night price tag",,,,,,,,
c50548,s4,Didn't try the restaurant outlets as I was told that they are no that attractive - you could get more reasonably priced and delicious food at coati or back to the Macau peninsula,,,,,,,,
c50548,s5,Taxi queues can be a big problem for hotels along the Cotai strip and this place is no exception,,,,,,,,
c50548,s6,Would only recommend this hotel only if you are going with family (i,,,,,,,,

c50548,s8,"you don't move around that often as traffic can be horrendous), and only if you are seeing shows_",,,,,,,,
c50549,s1,"Arrived to sheraton with their shuttle bus, being dropped with nobody told us where to check in or help with our luggage",,,,,,,,
c50549,s2,I tried to ask one of the door staff and all she did to reply is waving her hand making a gesture to make us go away,,,,,,,,
c50549,s3,"After getting inside and try to find SPG check in counter to no avail (since we are being dropped not in the main lobby), i lined up and queue in the check in counter, and after its my turn, when i walk and approach one of the receptionist (the name is Snow Zhang), she yelled at me loudly with some mandarin language that i dont understand and raise her hand making a halting gesture unpolitely and then proceed to make a phone call with a super sour face and ignoring me",,,,,,,,
c50549,s4,One of the other receptionist then handle my check in and at least he is_,,,,,,,,
c50550,s1,This was not my first trip to Macao,,,,,,,,
c50550,s2,I had already been there a couple of years before and had stayed at the MGM Grand,,,,,,,,
c50550,s3,"This time though I wanted to stay and experience a different property so after much homework on Trip Advisor, had zeroed down to The Sheraton Macao",,,,,,,,
c50550,s4,Well the trip started off on a rather rough note where I had booked for a private pick up from the Hotel through my travel agent,,,,,,,,
c50550,s5,When I arrived there at the ferry terminal there was no one to my surprise with my name card,,,,,,,,
c50550,s6,So called up my agent and he in turn called the Hotel and eventually found that there was someone there to pick me up but had wandered off somewhere instead of waiting for me at the visitors point,,,,,,,,
c50550,s7,Finally managed to meet him and after that things went on smooth,,,,,,,,
c50550,s8,The hotel itself is on the_,,,,,,,,
c50551,s1,"So far, every part of my stay at Sheraton Macau has been chaotic",,,,,,,,
c50551,s2,"Check-in was chaos with no orderly bell-hop service, and a queuing system longer than Disneyland",,,,,,,,
c50551,s3,The walk from reception to the elevators was like navigating an underground station at rush-hour,,,,,,,,
c50551,s4,The elevators were all full,,,,,,,,
c50551,s5,"The hotel lobby is more of a shopping mall than a foyer, with hundreds of people all about",,,,,,,,
c50551,s6,Every experience also seems so mechanical with sign-in needed at the pool even,,,,,,,,
c50551,s7,Actual sign-in,,,,,,,,
c50551,s8,With a pen,,,,,,,,
c50551,s9,And an attendance register,,,,,,,,
c50551,s10,"Breakfast requires queuing and being scanned-in by a computer, then queuing again, registering your table size, waiting, being pointed to a table, and before even sitting down being confronted with ""Please tea coffee?"" Breakfast was by far the most chaotic eating_",,,,,,,,
c50552,s1,Rooms - good size Pools - massive and still very crowded,,,,,,,,
c50552,s2,"but clean and well maintained breakfast - ensure you get your breakfast coupons at check in - otherwise you will have to wake up each morning, call the front desk and organise them as we had to",,,,,,,,
c50552,s3,food - average,,,,,,,,
c50552,s4,kids food menu is limited,,,,,,,,
c50552,s5,better to go to the food court either at the Conrad or the venetian and eat there,,,,,,,,
c50552,s6,the restaurants in the Sands area were well above par,,,,,,,,
c50552,s7,service - either fantastic or downright poor,,,,,,,,
c50552,s8,"to give an example here - at breakfast one morning, one of the servers went out of their way to make our 20 month daughter feel comfortable in the cold room by bringing her a shawl and wrapping her in it",,,,,,,,
c50552,s9,"on the other hand, when enquiring about the breakfast coupons I was told to go myself to the front_",,,,,,,,
c50553,s1,Spent a weekend here & believe you me that one can easily get lost in this hotel! Nice comfortable room with a comfortable bed,,,,,,,,
c50553,s2,Friendly staff,,,,,,,,
c50553,s3,"Concierge staff are amazing, very very helpful with a vast knowledge to guide you around discovering the city",,,,,,,,
c50553,s4,"Very accurate directions, in short very impressive",,,,,,,,
c50553,s5,Ensure when you leaving your room for an outing that you haven't forgotten anything otherwise its a long journey back to get it! Had an enjoyable stay everything in Macau is built in a grand scale,,,,,,,,
c50553,s6,The connecting corridor to the Venetian is very convenient & prettily done up,,,,,,,,
c50554,s1,I think this was my first and hopefully last time to stay at this hotel or any similar supersize wanna-be luxury hotel,,,,,,,,
c50554,s2,"The lobby is so huge, you can't even find out where to check in",,,,,,,,
c50554,s3,"The breakfast buffet was like a football stadium, with basically 1,000 people eating at the same time",,,,,,,,
c50554,s4,The staff doesn't speak ANY English and is very rude,,,,,,,,
c50554,s5,"For breakfast beverage they don't offer anything other than orange-juice, filter-coffee or pre-boiled tea",,,,,,,,
c50554,s6,"The selection is a nightmare, a damn nightmare, nothing else can describe that",,,,,,,,
c50554,s7,"I wonder which crazy nazi maniac planned this kind of hotel, but maybe it is a culturel difference",,,,,,,,
c50554,s8,Maybe for mainland Chinese this is actually their dream of having a vacation,,,,,,,,
c50555,s1,Opulent in theory,,,,,,,,
c50555,s2,"Rude and over-bearing front desk, bell boys and front desk supervisors make it the definite last option on the Cotai strip",,,,,,,,
c50555,s3,"A huge difference especially since we had just arrived from the classy, courteous,Shangri-La in Hong Kong which was the opposite",,,,,,,,
c50555,s4,The good things first: The rooms are super large,,,,,,,,
c50555,s5,"There is Vegas style opulence in the air, and in the fast developing amenities, all inter-connected, through the strip",,,,,,,,
c50555,s6,Housekeeping and security are great,,,,,,,,
c50555,s7,And room service was efficient and multi-lingual,,,,,,,,
c50555,s8,We were even politely informed of the construction activity in the distance and the remote possibility of there being noise due to the works happening,,,,,,,,
c50555,s9,But unfortunately the bad overshadow all the positives: As soon as one arrives one is greeted by an_,,,,,,,,
c50556,s1,"Stayed for 1 night only, booked a standard room and avail an upgrade worth MOP$700 for a club room (suite) with buffet breakfast, free wifi, everning coctails and all day snacks",,,,,,,,
c50556,s2,Huge and amazing pool area but too crowded,,,,,,,,
c50556,s3,Staff were accommodating and helfpul (front office and F&B),,,,,,,,
c50556,s4,Had our dinner at Bene Italian Restaurant; food were under salted,,,,,,,,
c50556,s5,We ordered a giant three scoop ice cream that was half melted already when it was served to us,,,,,,,,
c50557,s1,"This was my second stay here, and my 20th+ trip to Macau,",,,,,,,,
c50557,s2,I won't stay here again,,,,,,,,
c50557,s3,"The rooms are OK , well fitted out, but the conference team ruined my stay  I brought 50 people here to an event - and they offered to send two Madagascar characters to our training room",,,,,,,,
c50557,s4,"About an hour into our training, I realized they were going to change me MOP22,000 for a 15 mins appearance from two characters in suits",,,,,,,,
c50557,s5,"Can you imagine what you could do with MOP22,000?   So I cancelled them immediately, but the Conference team told me they needed to charge me 30% of the total cost (MOP6,000) for them NOT to show",,,,,,,,
c50557,s6,Thoroughly unprofessional approach,,,,,,,,
c50557,s7,"While this may be a suitable hotel for an overnight stay for the Casino , I would avoid it at all costs for conferences",,,,,,,,
c50558,s1,One of the biggest Sheratons,,,,,,,,
c50558,s2,Really nice location and a good hotel,,,,,,,,
c50558,s3,"Just that next time, I would probably pick a smaller hotel which has a more intimate feel to it",,,,,,,,
c50558,s4,This one takes you through very long winded corridors and you would probably not see a single soul on your floor sometimes,,,,,,,,
c50558,s5,"Also, the hotel staff is not conversant in English",,,,,,,,
c50558,s6,I was stuck outside my room since my key stopped working and it took all of 45 minutes and 4 staff including the manager to sort it out,,,,,,,,
c50558,s7,I had already missed my meeting by then,,,,,,,,
c50558,s8,Probably not much that the manager can do about this but I would suggest keeping those staff in customer facing roles who understand english,,,,,,,,
c50558,s9,Overall a good hotel in a great location,,,,,,,,
c50559,s1,I am a Platinum SPG member and expected far better service than received,,,,,,,,
c50559,s2,There are two very glaring issues with the staff,,,,,,,,
c50559,s3,1,,,,,,,,
c50559,s4,Their English is incomprehensible and 2,,,,,,,,
c50559,s5,They are unresponsive to the guest,,,,,,,,
c50559,s6,I'm here with a convention and asked that my SPG number be added to my account so I could be count this stay toward my 2014 nights,,,,,,,,
c50559,s7,"The response was, sorry you are booked at a group rate",,,,,,,,
c50559,s8,Now while that is true I do not understand why you would not allow one of your better customers to count these nights toward my 2014 qualification,,,,,,,,
c50559,s9,Makes no sense and makes me want to move my loyalty to another hotel chain,,,,,,,,
c50559,s10,The worst event so far is I was not allowed to order room service breakfast from the menu (which I had to ask to be sent up to my room and arrived 30 minutes later)_,,,,,,,,
c50560,s1,The hotel area very BIG!!! Hotel require deposit of HKD1000 and the staff forget to give us the cash deposit receipt,,,,,,,,
c50560,s2,But they personally send us the reciept to our room,,,,,,,,
c50560,s3,the room very nice and new,,,,,,,,
c50560,s4,Packages includes breakfast or lunch,,,,,,,,
c50560,s5,"We went for buffet lunch, worth and nice",,,,,,,,
c50560,s6,Not a good location to explore the Macau city,,,,,,,,
c50561,s1,I stayed in a number of hotels in Macau before but I found that it was the worst,,,,,,,,
c50561,s2,We arrived in the shuttle designated clearly for Sheraton Macao but we were dropped off in a side door and we faced very incompetent receptionist,,,,,,,,
c50561,s3,The checkin took ages and the experience was worse than a one-star Mainland China Hotel,,,,,,,,
c50561,s4,I booked through the Hotel's website but it seemed they didn't observe anything of my booking from their system,,,,,,,,
c50561,s5,The receiptionist did not know that I had booked the club floor and did not notice I wanted a non-smoking room,,,,,,,,
c50561,s6,"After the disastrous check-in, I could not find the way to my room",,,,,,,,
c50561,s7,It was written on the room card that i should be staying at Tower 1 but you could not find something called Tower 1 there,,,,,,,,
c50561,s8,The signs only show you to Earth Tower and whatever_,,,,,,,,
c50562,s1,"We were looking to make a quick trip to Macau for the night from Hong Kong since it was cheaper to stay a night, knowing we were flying out the next morning",,,,,,,,
c50562,s2,"Through Tripadvisor we found availability here and got wind of a Sheraton package including ferry tickets for the return to HKG and breakfast, which was exactly what we needed knowing we would have a long day ahead",,,,,,,,
c50562,s3,"When trying to book said package, their website wasn't working (pain in the butt)",,,,,,,,
c50562,s4,"I used their calling service to have them call my mobile, which I thought was nifty until they called and I could barely make out anything the agent was saying due to a poor connection or accent - couldn't tell either way",,,,,,,,
c50562,s5,They did manage to tell me however that they could honor the package for me if I booked upon arrival at the_,,,,,,,,
c50563,s1,We spent a night using the Cash + points at the Macau Sheraton in Mid June,,,,,,,,
c50563,s2,"The check in was smooth and I got the high floor which I requested,",,,,,,,,
c50563,s3,"Maybe because it was a  almost free room , the view was not what I expected",,,,,,,,
c50563,s4,The bed was comfortable and the room is at a good size,,,,,,,,
c50563,s5,The bathroom amenities were limited as there were only one set of shower gels shampoo  and 2 sets on towels and,,,,,,,,
c50563,s6,"Normally, you will get at least 2 sets of shampoos  shower gels and 3 sets of towels",,,,,,,,
c50563,s7,You have to request extra amenities,,,,,,,,
c50563,s8,"Other than that, everything was expected",,,,,,,,
c50564,s1,"room s are not nice , decoration is soso , only the bathroom is correct",,,,,,,,
c50564,s2,without the ashtray and smelly cigarette,,,,,,,,
c50564,s3,Very disappointed,,,,,,,,
c50564,s4,check in take forever,,,,,,,,
c50564,s5,room view was so bad,,,,,,,,
c50564,s6,"tv on the room was not set , only a few international channel",,,,,,,,
c50564,s7,will never go back,,,,,,,,
c50565,s1,I have always been a fan of Sheraton but this is the first time I'm staying in one in Asia,,,,,,,,
c50565,s2,The rooms and check in service are good and the hotel is not bad at all,,,,,,,,
c50565,s3,But I was very taken back when I called and requested for one extra big towel and they said that each room is only allow two sets of towels,,,,,,,,
c50565,s4,They can only do an exchange and is not allow to give extras,,,,,,,,
c50565,s5,I was so surprised by the answer that I just said ok and hung up,,,,,,,,
c50565,s6,I just feel so disappointed by being denied such simple request,,,,,,,,
c50565,s7,I could totally understand if its from a motel but from Sheraton? This experience totally changed my view on Sheraton,,,,,,,,
c50566,s1,Hotel is well appointed and clean,,,,,,,,
c50566,s2,It meets the expectations of the Sheraton brand,,,,,,,,
c50566,s3,You had to show your key to security to gain access to the lift lobby,,,,,,,,
c50566,s4,Guest floors were well maintained,,,,,,,,
c50566,s5,The room was nice and well serviced,,,,,,,,
c50566,s6,All areas of the room were clean,,,,,,,,
c50566,s7,Bed was ok although the pillows were very soft,,,,,,,,
c50566,s8,Room was quiet and had a nice view over one of the pools,,,,,,,,
c50566,s9,I loved that the curtains kept the room completely dark even in the morning,,,,,,,,
c50566,s10,Great wifi signal in the room,,,,,,,,
c50566,s11,A solid 4 to 5 star hotel based on the room and amenities,,,,,,,,
c50566,s12,Pools were nice but a bit small,,,,,,,,
c50566,s13,Unfortunately staff were not very friendly at all on both checkin and checkout,,,,,,,,
c50566,s14,Nor were the concierge and events booking staff very friendly,,,,,,,,
c50566,s15,Front desk seemed to be unable to cope with questions and very grumpy,,,,,,,,
c50566,s16,_,,,,,,,,
c50567,s1,Stayed in the deluxe suite with club access in the beginning of June,,,,,,,,
c50567,s2,I was also a spg member,,,,,,,,
c50567,s3,The hotel emailed me a preference list few days before the stay,,,,,,,,
c50567,s4,Check-in was bit confusing as I was directed to the spg lounge instead of the club lounge,,,,,,,,
c50567,s5,Finally got to the club lounge where Jessica checked us in,,,,,,,,
c50567,s6,Jessica was great thru out our stay,,,,,,,,
c50567,s7,Felt as if i was really a privileged guest,,,,,,,,
c50567,s8,Breakfast and cocktails were served in the lounge,,,,,,,,
c50567,s9,The standard of the food was average,,,,,,,,
c50567,s10,I should have saved the extra $ and have my breakfast in other outlets,,,,,,,,
c50567,s11,We stayed in the sky tower on 32nd floor facing the pools,,,,,,,,
c50567,s12,I was informed during check in that the top 2 floors were undergoing renovations but we stuck to our choice for a high floor,,,,,,,,
c50567,s13,The noise was bearable,,,,,,,,
c50567,s14,Sheraton's shuttle was_,,,,,,,,
c50568,s1,Spent 3 nights at the hotel for business/personal holiday,,,,,,,,
c50568,s2,The check-in was hassle free,,,,,,,,
c50568,s3,the concierge staff who assisted my wife for ferry tickets to HKIA and booking of dancing water show was fantastic,,,,,,,,
c50568,s4,He walked a long distance with them just to show them the way to the dancing water theatre to buy tickets,,,,,,,,
c50568,s5,The room was big and a welcomed change after staying the previous 5 nights in HK Sheraton - their twin beds were super single size which my 2 young girls could share comfortably,,,,,,,,
c50568,s6,This deserved 5 star rating from me The housekeeping was the worst I had experienced for all my hotel stay (and I am comparing only 5 stars hotel),,,,,,,,
c50568,s7,I declined the offer to opt out of the housing keep (in exchange for some SPG points),,,,,,,,
c50568,s8,"For my entire 3 nights, the toiletries were not replenished -_",,,,,,,,
c50569,s1,This review is really for travelers with families/ small children,,,,,,,,
c50569,s2,"Rest of the stay was standards standard room, standard buffet, standard amenities",,,,,,,,
c50569,s3,"We went for 2 nights 3 days with our daughter, and stayed in a deluxe room",,,,,,,,
c50569,s4,"Overall, we felt uncomfortable with the facilities and standards for safety for children",,,,,,,,
c50569,s5,"Now for specifics:  Travel to the hotel - We got into the shuttle alright, but when we reached the hotel there was no one to watch over buses coming and going",,,,,,,,
c50569,s6,The driver simply stopped and opened the luggage carriage as asked us to exit quickly since he had to leave immediately,,,,,,,,
c50569,s7,"So I climbed in (cause our luggage was at the back) while my 2 year old daughter stood IN THE MIDDLE of the road, because she wouldn't stay on the side alone with dozens of guests trying to_",,,,,,,,
c50570,s1,"As a fairly regular Macau visitor, I decided to stay on the Strip for a change, as I was travelling with a group of friends",,,,,,,,
c50570,s2,"It's fair to say that we were not the target demographic of the hotel, but the pool shut at 6pm, and there was no bar apart from a weird lobby cafe",,,,,,,,
c50570,s3,"Good food options were also very limited: fortunately, we know Fernando's! A strange hotel",,,,,,,,
c50570,s4,Back to the Westin or one of the other Strip hotels next time,,,,,,,,
c50570,s5,"For the biggest Sheraton in the world (and presumably their flagship hotel), this place needs some work, as do the staff who were unable to comply with a simple request to leave a couple of water bottles outside the room, so as not to wake my friend up",,,,,,,,
c50570,s6,"Come on, Sheraton, you can do better than this!",,,,,,,,
c50571,s1,"In this trip, we spend one night to live in Hotel Okura Macau and one night in Sheraton",,,,,,,,
c50571,s2,"If you think the Starwood association which provides SPG (Starwood Preferred Guest) always has great  and amazing hotel, you might disappoint on the Sheraton in Macau",,,,,,,,
c50571,s3,We spend about 250 USD( in the weekend of the holiday) for one night and I think it was not worthy,,,,,,,,
c50571,s4,"The lobby smells of smoke (maybe the Casino is next to the lobby, the smoke might come from there)",,,,,,,,
c50571,s5,The room is just a normal size and it provides not enough towels and base rope,,,,,,,,
c50571,s6,"I think I'll spend more 100 USD to live in Hotel Okura Macau again, because the room size of Okura is triple size than Sheraton and everything in Hotel Okura Macau is better than Sheraton",,,,,,,,
c50571,s7,You only need to spend about 100 USD and you will feel_,,,,,,,,
c50572,s1,This is world's largest Sheraton Hotel located in Macau Cotai area,,,,,,,,
c50572,s2,There are two reception area and SPG reception area on 4th floor,,,,,,,,
c50572,s3,Try to avoid the reception area in front ot MacDonald which is rude and lack of SPG knowledge,,,,,,,,
c50572,s4,"For SPG members, room upgrades are not given unless you strongly asked for it",,,,,,,,
c50572,s5,We booked suite room which is large and luxury with standard above typical Sheraton room,,,,,,,,
c50572,s6,Service level within the hotel is good except for those in reception area,,,,,,,,
c50572,s7,"If you are looking for better service, go to Conrad Hotel",,,,,,,,
c50573,s1,1 / The lobby having long queue and need me to wait at least 15 minutes,,,,,,,,
c50573,s2,"The hotel have a lots of counters but no good signage or direction system just guiding by the staffs (seems higher level), specially I noticed a male who is short fat guy is the guiding staff, but he was talking with the mobile phones, then walking around and just walk away to the back office in sudden",,,,,,,,
c50573,s3,"Why he came to guide us and ran away if he is too busy?  That is not a good service which Sheraton should be  2 / there have a lot of lanes, but the mainland Chinese always jumping the queue or just go directly to the counters from the exit area, but no security guards force them to lane back",,,,,,,,
c50573,s4,"So, what is the meaning that I wait so long for lining up?  3 / The front desk staff assist me to do the check_",,,,,,,,
c50574,s1,Now we all know that Macau/HK people are comparatively rude compared to the rest of the world but I would never expect that the staff in a 5-star hotel are the same,,,,,,,,
c50574,s2,I am talking about the staff stationed at the entrance to the lifts (those who check your hotel key-cards),,,,,,,,
c50574,s3,The manner in which they spoke to you made it seem like you were passing through a security check-point (gave off a vibe that made you feel as if you were someone trying to sneak through the security into a hotel that you could not afford),,,,,,,,
c50574,s4,"To top it all off, no smiles, no 'good mornings, good evenings'",,,,,,,,
c50574,s5,"Heck, even staff in budget hotels know very well that those are the basics in the hospitality industry",,,,,,,,
c50574,s6,"While I have no problems with the rest of the hotel, this one blemish is enough to warrant an 'average_",,,,,,,,
c50575,s1,We made a spontaneous visit from Hong Kong during the Buddhist's Birthday holiday,,,,,,,,
c50575,s2,This was our 3rd time staying in this Sheraton but we left with great disappointment,,,,,,,,
c50575,s3,"Upon arrival, we noticed that the priority check in area for SPG members are already closed, so we had to queue up for quite a while at the reception",,,,,,,,
c50575,s4,The staff was pretty slow and their English level was far from the proper standard,,,,,,,,
c50575,s5,"As a loyal member, we didn't feel welcome at all as there were no special greetings and offer etc",,,,,,,,
c50575,s6,"The staff started asking us questions like one bed or two beds, smoking or non smoking, higher or lower floor - I told him I already listed all my requests in my booking and it was shown in my member profile",,,,,,,,
c50575,s7,This is ridiculous!  Then my issue with them was - since I made the booking_,,,,,,,,
c50576,s1,We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in mid-April,,,,,,,,
c50576,s2,"First impression, it looked pretty good however that quickly deteriorated by the time we got to the desk",,,,,,,,
c50576,s3,I understand that I am in China - not back here in the US but the communication issue is so frustrating,,,,,,,,
c50576,s4,"For a brand that I believe (pls correct me if I'm wrong) is based in the US, I would expect at least one person in the desk all the time that speaks fluent English",,,,,,,,
c50576,s5,(This was an issue with the rest of our stay here),,,,,,,,
c50576,s6,The next day - we had better luck asking for directions from the concierge  on one of the other hotels (Holiday Inn?) that is adjoined with this one,,,,,,,,
c50576,s7,The accomodations were pretty good,,,,,,,,
c50576,s8,"Comfortable beds, great view of the city, nice bathroom",,,,,,,,
c50576,s9,"At least we enjoyed the buffet breakfast, just do sign_",,,,,,,,
c50577,s1,"I will start my review arriving in Macau, wow that was an experience ! Immigration was so slack that I still have my embankment card in my wallet as no one collected it or checked as we came through from Australia! We were confused as signage was poor or in Chinese which we can't read as to where to get our bags, could not find anyone who spoke enough English to help",,,,,,,,
c50577,s2,Finally got our bags and went to find the shuttle to the Sheraton,,,,,,,,
c50577,s3,Again we had no idea as other hotels had people with signs at the airport but not Sheraton,,,,,,,,
c50577,s4,It was actually a tour guide from Whyn hotel who showed us how to get to the shuttle,,,,,,,,
c50577,s5,Once there we had the rudest and most unhelpful driver I have ever come across who just pointed and grunted at us,,,,,,,,
c50577,s6,We arrived at reception and got checked in and shown to_,,,,,,,,
c50578,s1,I am a SPG PLATINUM member and used to love staying at the Sheraton group of hotels around the world,,,,,,,,
c50578,s2,"I have had long stays at stays at Sheraton Hong Kong,  sometimes up to almost a year at a stretch",,,,,,,,
c50578,s3,I used to greatly enjoy the hospitality and efficiency of the staff and the quality of the rooms and other services,,,,,,,,
c50578,s4,So it was a shocking experience in Macau Sheraton,,,,,,,,
c50578,s5,"Though the staff try their best to look courteous and attentive, there seems an air of utter chaos every where",,,,,,,,
c50578,s6,"The moment you enter the main lobby, you are lost in the sea of people and the chatter and clatter reminds you of some over crowded flea market",,,,,,,,
c50578,s7,Chaos seems to prevail everywhere and in everything you want to do,,,,,,,,
c50578,s8,I  Maybe it's because of the large number Chinese mainland tourists??  No I don't think_,,,,,,,,
c50579,s1,Had stayed in the sky tower on its opening and now am in the Earth tower,,,,,,,,
c50579,s2,Service is deteriorating - no welcome drink but luckily the check in reception service is good,,,,,,,,
c50579,s3,"Upon entering room, no room slippers, one table lamp and two ceiling light bulbs blown, no bar soap",,,,,,,,
c50579,s4,Nice coffee provided but no fresh milk capsule - only creamer which really spoilt the drink,,,,,,,,
c50579,s5,This should not be a 5 star standard,,,,,,,,
c50579,s6,Leave message on table on above so that housekeeping can do the needful but too bad the staff cannot read English and message was left unattended,,,,,,,,
c50579,s7,Also after cleaning room no bath mat and no refill for shower gel,,,,,,,,
c50579,s8,Need to call and request staff to bring,,,,,,,,
c50579,s9,Typically there is no supervision to ensure everything is properly in place,,,,,,,,
c50579,s10,This is really shameful!,,,,,,,,
c50580,s1,I was told that this is Sheraton biggest hotel property in the world with 6000+ rooms! This place is huge but soulless,,,,,,,,
c50580,s2,I don't feel like a hotel guest but a shopper in a huge shopping mall with casino,,,,,,,,
c50580,s3,The room is spacious but of standard design,,,,,,,,
c50580,s4,I hardly get to interact with hotel staff at main lobby and concierge because they are located so far from my Sky Tower room,,,,,,,,
c50580,s5,"Due to too many hotel guests, one can do an express check out by dropping the room card into a box at lift lobby",,,,,,,,
c50580,s6,"As a result, hardly any chance for human interaction",,,,,,,,
c50580,s7,"As a SPG, the hotel offers a room wifi service at MOP 30",,,,,,,,
c50580,s8,"I won't recommend purchasing any wifi service because the connection kept dropping and the speed, well",,,,,,,,
c50580,s9,there was hardy any speed I guess,,,,,,,,
c50580,s10,"Compared to Galaxy Hotel, free shuttle bus_",,,,,,,,
c50581,s1,This is not a good choice for the travelers who seek the experience of visiting Macau's historical heritage sites,,,,,,,,
c50581,s2,"However, it is a good place for those who enjoy casino, high end shopping and entertainment shows",,,,,,,,
c50581,s3,Children will not enjoy this place,,,,,,,,
c50582,s1,We went for an overnight stay in Sheraton,,,,,,,,
c50582,s2,We chose this over the others because they seemed to be the most child friendly on paper,,,,,,,,
c50582,s3,Turns out it was worse than picking a hostel,,,,,,,,
c50582,s4,"W arrived by ferry from Hong Kong and upon arrival, I immediately went to the information desk and asked where the hotel bus transfer was and was told to cross the underpass and find them there",,,,,,,,
c50582,s5,"While the other hotels had clearly marked buses, Sheraton had a print out of their logo on a piece of paper mounted under the steering wheel",,,,,,,,
c50582,s6,Suffice to say it took us some time to find that one bus among the dozens randomly parked,,,,,,,,
c50582,s7,"Then when we did find the us, the attendants couldn't care less that I was carrying my 4 year old with our backpack and pulling 2 strollers with one hand",,,,,,,,
c50582,s8,Awesome,,,,,,,,
c50582,s9,they didn't even_,,,,,,,,
c50583,s1,We visit this hotel again since last July and realized services continue to be poor and no improvement has been in place at all! We moved to Sheraton after spending a night in Grand Hyatt,,,,,,,,
c50583,s2,Nothing to be compared as it is a 2-star versus 5-star,,,,,,,,
c50583,s3,We were diverted to another side of the lobby for checking in without realizing we were club patrons and ended up waited 10 meaningless minutes before heading to club lounge check in,,,,,,,,
c50583,s4,"Nobody acknowledged us while sitting down at the club lounge, not a smile and of course none service at all",,,,,,,,
c50583,s5,Unclear message was given upon check in and we eventually went to the wrong side of the hotel and tried opening a wrong door,,,,,,,,
c50583,s6,Housekeeping girl provided nil service and only told us about the wrong direction and we have to deal with this through_,,,,,,,,
c50584,s1,We were awaken in the morning (that too after a late night sleep) by continuous attempt of opening our door even when the DO NOT DISTURB was turned on (we guess they could not ring the bell as DND was on),,,,,,,,
c50584,s2,We were too annoyed by the noise and opened the door to find out some random guests thought that it was their room,,,,,,,,
c50584,s3,"Mistakes happen, so no big deal",,,,,,,,
c50584,s4,"However, what we could not believe is that they were accompanied by a hotel staff who took them to our room not realising their room was in other tower",,,,,,,,
c50584,s5,Not only the staff did not check their room number but also he did not respect any value for our privacy (neither the red light for DND on our door bell),,,,,,,,
c50584,s6,How pity!,,,,,,,,
c50585,s1,My girlfriend and I stayed here for our one night in Macao to experience the casino atmosphere,,,,,,,,
c50585,s2,Unbeknown to us this hotel is combined with several others all under one roof and is linked to The Venetian across the road via a flyover walkway,,,,,,,,
c50585,s3,The hotel is designed so that you never need to leave the complex which is fine but not what we were looking for,,,,,,,,
c50585,s4,The gambling arena and shopping facilities at The Venetian are pretty good but I felt that we were on the outskirts of the action,,,,,,,,
c50585,s5,We got a cab to the MGM grand at night and visited The Wynn and The Grand Lisboa,,,,,,,,
c50585,s6,This seemed much more central and where the action was at,,,,,,,,
c50585,s7,Notwithstanding the above the rooms were very nice and the hotel itself fine enough with plenty of good eateries to choose from,,,,,,,,
c50585,s8,There was also a free shuttle_,,,,,,,,
c50586,s1,We ordered and extra bed and blankets for our room,,,,,,,,
c50586,s2,Someone came in 20 minutes and brought the blankets but no bed,,,,,,,,
c50586,s3,When we called the front desk and asked where the bed was they said we first needed to pay at the front desk,,,,,,,,
c50586,s4,They could not just charge the room,,,,,,,,
c50586,s5,When we wanted to use the internet,,,,,,,,
c50586,s6,"same story, come to the front desk and pay for it first",,,,,,,,
c50586,s7,When we wanted to have a coke from the mini bar it was locked,,,,,,,,
c50586,s8,Guess what they said?? Come to the front desk first to pay for it first,,,,,,,,
c50586,s9,All the food was high priced Asian crap except for Bene,,,,,,,,
c50586,s10,The problem with Bene was the hair I found,,,,,,,,
c50587,s1,"To start with: while the rooms are nice, the location is just wrong",,,,,,,,
c50587,s2,"Construction sides all around, and a rather poor casino in the complex",,,,,,,,
c50587,s3,Rather recommend to stay in Galaxy (much nicer inside) or better stay on Macau side which is more authentic and less clinical,,,,,,,,
c50587,s4,"If you go for Sheraton, upgrade to a lounge room, the premium is worth it",,,,,,,,
c50588,s1,"Whereas the room itself was fairly modern and tidy, got few points to note -  1) There are areas in the pool side which are full of exhaust gas smell from the adjacent kitchen(?), which brings cooked burned oil smell in the pool area",,,,,,,,
c50588,s2,Fairly unpleasant - we ended up changing our seats twice before found a spot where there is no ventilation noise or smell,,,,,,,,
c50588,s3,Just poor design really,,,,,,,,
c50588,s4,"2) It was a slow service to order food to pool area, drinks took borderline 15minutes and pool snacks about 40 minutes",,,,,,,,
c50588,s5,Suggest bring your own drinks & snacks,,,,,,,,
c50588,s6,easier,,,,,,,,
c50588,s7,There's a McDonalds nearby :)  3) Wi-Fi connection non-existent to poor - tried and tested in the room and also on the pool side,,,,,,,,
c50588,s8,Perhaps cable connection is better (provided in the room too),,,,,,,,
c50588,s9,4) Overflow of rubbish along the hotel_,,,,,,,,
c50589,s1,I have been to Macao for business conference and got a chance to stay in Shreaton Cotai Central,,,,,,,,
c50589,s2,Checkin formality was managed by our company event management team hence that was okay,,,,,,,,
c50589,s3,Pro: Rooms are good with all the basic facility provided within the room,,,,,,,,
c50589,s4,/ Size of the room is also big enough good space,,,,,,,,
c50589,s5,/ Bathroom is also very big and good,,,,,,,,
c50589,s6,Cons: Staff is not well aware on the English,,,,,,,,
c50589,s7,/ Almost no option for Vegi like me,,,,,,,,
c50589,s8,/ Very difficult to get in to room being a very big hotel and confusing ways,,,,,,,,
c50589,s9,Do think twice before visiting with family,,,,,,,,
c50589,s10,be ready to walk a lot within the hotel itself,,,,,,,,
c50589,s11,Overall its a mix experience to me,,,,,,,,
c50589,s12,did not find cool feeling,,,,,,,,
c50590,s1,With the Sheraton name you expect a little more from a Casino resort,,,,,,,,
c50590,s2,As soon as you walk in the hotel is confusing,,,,,,,,
c50590,s3,The SPG check in area has no ramp access from the front so if you have alot of luggage that's going to be an inconvenience,,,,,,,,
c50590,s4,The woman at the check in counter lost our initial reservation and tried to make up for it by offering free wifi,,,,,,,,
c50590,s5,In reality my entire hotel floor has free wifi,,,,,,,,
c50590,s6,"Laptop connection is just fine however, it will kick you off after 5 min for inactivity on a wireless device fyi",,,,,,,,
c50590,s7,I would have rather paid for  my own access to avoid this,,,,,,,,
c50590,s8,Felt like a cheap ploy from the receptionist to offer free wifi when in reality it's free,,,,,,,,
c50590,s9,Rooms are nice and the pool is great,,,,,,,,
c50590,s10,I've only eaten the buffet breakfast so far and it was pretty good,,,,,,,,
c50590,s11,Just plan to_,,,,,,,,
c50591,s1,This isn't so much about the hotel as the area in general,,,,,,,,
c50591,s2,"Our tour company booked us into what is billed as ""the biggest Sheraton in the world"" with something like 3,880 rooms (yep)",,,,,,,,
c50591,s3,The hotel is spic-and-span new but its hugeness is overwhelming,,,,,,,,
c50591,s4,A one-night stay saw a lot of time spent trying to find the right lobby (several of them) and the right bank of elevators,,,,,,,,
c50591,s5,Our room was utilitarian compared to other five-star hotels,,,,,,,,
c50591,s6,"The breakfast buffet (included) was the best feature, we felt",,,,,,,,
c50591,s7,"This Sheraton is located on Cotai Island, a section of Macao under international mega-development as a clone of Las Vegas, lots of construction going on, themed ""City of Dreams",,,,,,,,
c50591,s8,""" Right: it's far from the historic centre of a very interesting city, with no local neighbourhoods to explore, or_",,,,,,,,
c50592,s1,I booked a Suite at the Sheraton for 2 nights to celebrate my fiancee's birthday from 24-26 March,,,,,,,,
c50592,s2,"This is my first time staying at the Sheraton property, however, it didn't leave me with a good impression",,,,,,,,
c50592,s3,"My fiancee's birthday was on 24 March which I had already informed the hotel prior our arrival, the staff who checked us in was nice and friendly, but there might be some system error, the registration card was showing the wrong departure date, but problem had been fixed quickly, then we go to the elevator with our suitcase with NO ASSISTANCE",,,,,,,,
c50592,s4,"Room in the Sky Tower on the 33th floor was assigned to us, the room was nice, clean, simple but absolutely comfortable",,,,,,,,
c50592,s5,"However, when we just settled ourselves, there were some noises coming from the top (Drilling walls &_",,,,,,,,
c50593,s1,This is the third time i stay in this hotel,,,,,,,,
c50593,s2,"The room is still very good, spacious and  make me feel relaxed and comfortable",,,,,,,,
c50593,s3,However two of my friends room card didn't work when we come back to the room after having our breakfast downstairs,,,,,,,,
c50593,s4,We called to the front desk for help and we wait for the staff for 15 mins to open our room which had not been check out,,,,,,,,
c50593,s5,This is our first time we experienced this bad situation in any hotel we visited,,,,,,,,
c50593,s6,"Please ensure your room card system stable, not to bother your customers like that",,,,,,,,
c50593,s7,"One of the staff in the express check out counter is not very helpful, i forget her name,  but her attitude is really bad, make me a bit angry",,,,,,,,
c50593,s8,this kind of staff cannot be found in any service industry,,,,,,,,
c50594,s1,I really like this hotel,,,,,,,,
c50594,s2,I have stayed here many times since opening,,,,,,,,
c50594,s3,"Great gym, very nice pool's  Good spa Facilities  But the room service choice is very limited especially in relation to western choices and quality  Simple things like no club sandwich or standard hotel room service things like steak or chicken Been like this for over a year and always frustrates me when I visit  Also currently some construction taking place on the higher floors",,,,,,,,
c50595,s1,"Very easy to get to the Hotel from the Airport, 5 mins maximum, but then the fun starts",,,,,,,,
c50595,s2,"The check in desks (there are many) are accessed by a immigration style line queue, and all though they had about 8 desks open, it still takes an age to get to the desk",,,,,,,,
c50595,s3,"Finally I make it, find out Im in the Earth tower, 21st floor",,,,,,,,
c50595,s4,"You make your own way to the elevators, nobody carries your bag or guides you in the right direction and it would be quite easy to get lost, this place is massive",,,,,,,,
c50595,s5,"Up to the room, very impressed, nice layout excellent bed, nice and quiet, all good so far",,,,,,,,
c50595,s6,"Return to my room after a walkabout, according to the TV i have a voicemail and written messages, I go over to the phone and desperately search for the voicemail button, there isn't one, ring guest_",,,,,,,,
c50596,s1,This was our first overnight trip to Macau to attend the Rolling Stones concert,,,,,,,,
c50596,s2,"We chose the Sheraton because it was so close to the concert venue and due to availability, quality and price",,,,,,,,
c50596,s3,This is apparently the largest Sheraton in the world and it showed in terms of the huge numbers of people in and around the hotel,,,,,,,,
c50596,s4,We took the shuttle bus from the Macau Ferry Terminal and were very impressed with how easy it was to get to the hotel and check in,,,,,,,,
c50596,s5,"I'd booked through an online site and on arrival was informed that neither breakfast or WiFi was included in the booking, but that I could add this for a cost as an SPG member, which I did",,,,,,,,
c50596,s6,"The place is HUGE, but the room we were given was very nice",,,,,,,,
c50596,s7,The hotel itself is part of a huge shopping complex that attaches 4-5 hotels_,,,,,,,,
c50597,s1,I have stayed in many new hotels in Macau and Sheraton Macao is probably the worst I have ever stayed,,,,,,,,
c50597,s2,Inattentive Staff I booked the hotel room and transportation through the travel agent in one go to save time and effort,,,,,,,,
c50597,s3,"As I wanted to request for a non-smoking room with king-size bed, I wrote an email directly to Sheraton Macao",,,,,,,,
c50597,s4,"In the email, I clearly informed the officer that I have already booked a room (with my personal particulars and date of stay) and would like to add a remark to my booking",,,,,,,,
c50597,s5,"Sadly, the officer handled my email unconcernedly and gave me a room quotation instead",,,,,,,,
c50597,s6,I have never expected such heedless working attitude or poor language proficiency from Sheraton Staff,,,,,,,,
c50597,s7,New but not worth I regretted choosing Sheraton Macao instead of other big brand_,,,,,,,,
c50598,s1,"The breakfast is unpleasant, the place is heaving with people, Palms the bar/coffee shop next to reception is an exercise in patience",,,,,,,,
c50598,s2,Outside of the room this is a tiresome experience as is much of Macau these days,,,,,,,,
c50598,s3,The staff are very pleasant though,,,,,,,,
c50598,s4,Will not be returning,,,,,,,,
c50599,s1,Stayed in the Deluxe room for 1 night last week,,,,,,,,
c50599,s2,Luckily only 1 night in this hotel,,,,,,,,
c50599,s3,"The hotel is pretty new, however it feels more like a 4 star hotel rather than 5 star",,,,,,,,
c50599,s4,The facilities and hardware are still in good conditions,,,,,,,,
c50599,s5,"Personally,, i don't like the pillows which are too soft",,,,,,,,
c50599,s6,"Since it has a lot of rooms, so the lobby is very busy without any 5 star hotel touch",,,,,,,,
c50599,s7,The sound proof of the room is terrible,,,,,,,,
c50599,s8,"It was a family staying next to my room, and i think the 2 kids were very excited with their holiday",,,,,,,,
c50599,s9,We could hear very clearly when they were playing at the door area and running along the hallway happily,,,,,,,,
c50599,s10,I was waken up by them at 7am++,,,,,,,,
c50599,s11,"If you are a light sleeper, may consider request for a quiet room",,,,,,,,
c50599,s12,"Another incident happened during our checked in, there was a_",,,,,,,,
c50600,s1,I took the offer of Sands to enjoya cheaper rate of this hotel but I never expected the service quality would follow the price,,,,,,,,
c50600,s2,"But with same charge, I could  book Ponte 16 through a travel agent and enjoyed much better service quality of Ponte 16  although the casino there is much smaller in size, but within 15 mintues walk, I could go to other casinos",,,,,,,,
c50600,s3,"Previously, I could check in and get the room before 12 noon",,,,,,,,
c50600,s4,"This time, even I offered to complete the check in procedure and got the door key after 1 p",,,,,,,,
c50600,s5,m,,,,,,,,
c50600,s6,", I was still rejected",,,,,,,,
c50600,s7,Only few guests at the two front desk zones at that time,,,,,,,,
c50600,s8,"Being a SPG member, without the membership card, for the first time, I was refused to the membership zone for checking in",,,,,,,,
c50600,s9,I had to go to the other check in zone to verify my identity_,,,,,,,,
c50601,s1,"Within two hours of arriving at this hotel,I could tell you more than five things wrong with it",,,,,,,,
c50601,s2,"(1)asked to change room, none was available",,,,,,,,
c50601,s3,"(2)not all elevators goes to all floors, confusing",,,,,,,,
c50601,s4,"(3)can't charge restaurant bill to room,system down(4)largest hotel, by who's standards",,,,,,,,
c50601,s5,"(5)who in their right mind would design rooms facing each other, so your view is the room in the other tower",,,,,,,,
c50601,s6,"Sheraton, what a wasted investment,five star hotel, maybe,but definitely one star experience!",,,,,,,,
c50602,s1,One of the the worst hotel I ever stayed,,,,,,,,
c50602,s2,1,,,,,,,,
c50602,s3,"You checked in, follow the sign to the lift, reached your floor, and guess what, you can not find your room",,,,,,,,
c50602,s4,Your room number was not in this floor,,,,,,,,
c50602,s5,"Then you called hotel, then they told you that your room number is in ANOTHER building",,,,,,,,
c50602,s6,"What ? Why not tell me when I checked in ? Their answer, 'sorry, we forgot'",,,,,,,,
c50602,s7,2,,,,,,,,
c50602,s8,"OK, then you have to drag your luggage and go to another building",,,,,,,,
c50602,s9,"Finally found your room, open the door",,,,,,,,
c50602,s10,You got confused again,,,,,,,,
c50602,s11,You asked for a NON-Smoking room,,,,,,,,
c50602,s12,But the one you got is obviously heavily SMOKING room,,,,,,,,
c50602,s13,"You called and they said, 'sorry",,,,,,,,
c50602,s14,' again,,,,,,,,
c50602,s15,3,,,,,,,,
c50602,s16,"Fine, maybe just open the window to get some fresh air",,,,,,,,
c50602,s17,Then you wanted to check your email,,,,,,,,
c50602,s18,But found out your could not connect into internet,,,,,,,,
c50602,s19,"Call IT,_",,,,,,,,
c50603,s1,I went there with family on 1 Feb and stayed there for 2 nights,,,,,,,,
c50603,s2,"The room was OK, but not as good as I expected",,,,,,,,
c50603,s3,The bedding and pillow is good,,,,,,,,
c50603,s4,But the housekeeping is not,,,,,,,,
c50603,s5,"After we came back from the sightseeing in the afternoon on the second day, we found the hair dryer was not put back at where it was",,,,,,,,
c50603,s6,"The robe was put where my husband left that morning, which was on the chair",,,,,,,,
c50603,s7,The worse part was the housekeeping did not clean the coffee maker,,,,,,,,
c50603,s8,We needed to clean it by ourselves,,,,,,,,
c50604,s1,"This hotel has not met my expectations during my stay already:  - no upgrade for SPG Gold member  - late checkout to 4PM was given, but extension of late checkout from 4PM to 6PM was denied  - coffee press not cleaned and kettle not put away during room servicing  - request for a power adapter for my US three-plugged laptop was not available ('we don't support that"")   But the biggest disappointment was in the checkout",,,,,,,,
c50604,s2,I had to make some calls to Cathay Pacific Marco Polo Club for a booking,,,,,,,,
c50604,s3,"Unfortunately, Marco Polo made it very difficult to call in - the call gets connected but then drops into voicemail",,,,,,,,
c50604,s4,But Marco Polo has a toll-free number in Macau Local calls in Macau are *free*,,,,,,,,
c50604,s5,"Of course, there is a fixed monthly connection charge",,,,,,,,
c50604,s6,Just like HK - so rather than use my_,,,,,,,,
c50605,s1,It was the second time we stayed in Sheraton,,,,,,,,
c50605,s2,Last time was last CNY when the hotel was just opened and needed lots of improvement,,,,,,,,
c50605,s3,I came again in CNY this year and found the signage problem and availability of express check out were improved,,,,,,,,
c50605,s4,"However, this year my disappointment was on dining",,,,,,,,
c50605,s5,"Being a 5 star hotel,  all hotel restaurants did not accept booking because they said it was CNY",,,,,,,,
c50605,s6,How ridiculous,,,,,,,,
c50605,s7,"It turned out that I dined in four seasons the first night which not only accepted booking, table was also ready when I arrived on time",,,,,,,,
c50605,s8,"The second evening, in order to avoid the crowd, I have an early diner at 630 in the italian restaurant",,,,,,,,
c50605,s9,You know what happened? The restaurant staff asked whether I made a booking!!!!! The hotel definitely needed to improve its catering_,,,,,,,,
c50606,s1,It is very poor in restaurant and room service,,,,,,,,
c50606,s2,I found out my belonging being stolen after my back home,,,,,,,,
c50606,s3,Something very personal but very European style,,,,,,,,
c50606,s4,I can't believe it,,,,,,,,
c50606,s5,I will not recommend this hotel to any of my friend especially people from Europe,,,,,,,,
c50607,s1,"You know what really grinds my gears about this hotel? That I paid for their second biggest suite, threw a dinner which cost USD 600 in the same suite, and they still refuse to credit me with my loyalty points",,,,,,,,
c50607,s2,"Butler service was good, in fairness",,,,,,,,
c50607,s3,"Oh, and the second room in the suite smelled of sewage",,,,,,,,
c50607,s4,No apology was forthcoming,,,,,,,,
c50608,s1,The hotel is located right at the centre of the Cotai strip so is quite central in that sense,,,,,,,,
c50608,s2,Unfortunately the very common and un exclusive experience starts from the time you come out of the ferry and have to wait around for buses and the bus to get to Sheraton is also confusing,,,,,,,,
c50608,s3,"When you get to the hotel, given how large it is and in the midst of almost a circus/carnival like atmosphere, the first impression you get is one of ""how can this be a Sheraton property!""",,,,,,,,
c50608,s4,"You have to carry your bag yourselves and that too quite a distance, wait for ling lines to check in",,,,,,,,
c50608,s5,"Once you check in, the rooms, for close to USD 225/250 a night are just not value for money",,,,,,,,
c50608,s6,Overall too expensive for the experience and I wouldn't stay here again,,,,,,,,
c50608,s7,This given that iam an SPG GOLD MEMBER and stay_,,,,,,,,
c50609,s1,Apparently the Sheraton in Macau is the largest hotel within the chains properties and I'm not in anyway surprised,,,,,,,,
c50609,s2,It is huge,,,,,,,,
c50609,s3,There are a number of towers clustered around the casino that form the Sheraton and a Conrad and a Holiday Inn within the same complex along with the expected Macau luxe retail experience,,,,,,,,
c50609,s4,It's huge,,,,,,,,
c50609,s5,It also means that the checkin lines are also huge however they seem to move at a reasonable pace,,,,,,,,
c50609,s6,"We had two twin rooms adjoining on the members level and they were both clean, comfortable, modern and very clean",,,,,,,,
c50609,s7,No complaints at all,,,,,,,,
c50609,s8,"Pros Close to the two big players in Macau - Venetian and City of Dreams Reasonable walking distance to City of Dreams cirque water show Rooms are modern, spacious, clean  Cons Lack of reasonably priced restaurants -_",,,,,,,,
c50610,s1,"we arrived at the hotel thru their free shuttle bus, but after we get off the bus, my mom was falled down and her head hit the corner of drive path",,,,,,,,
c50610,s2,"head was breeding and we ask the hotel to call ambulance and send her to hospital nearby, after surgery we went back to the hotel",,,,,,,,
c50610,s3,"we stay there one night, during the time we stay there, none of their staff visit us or make any concern",,,,,,,,
c50610,s4,seems money is most important for them,,,,,,,,
c50610,s5,Sheraton means money?? _________________________________________________________________________________________,,,,,,,,
c50611,s1,At 4000 rooms it certainly is & if bigger is better than this is just your cup of tea,,,,,,,,
c50611,s2,"As SPG members, my husband & I generally stay at one of the group hotels & have to admit this would not be my top choice - primarily because its so large as to seem almost impersonal",,,,,,,,
c50611,s3,"Having said that, rooms are large & well-lit with good amenities & the staff are generally pleasant & very helpful but that little personal touch we have so come to expect from the Starwood Group was just missing",,,,,,,,
c50611,s4,"It is very conveniently located with all the casinos, the theatre (Dancing Water) as well as the dining district (two great Portugese restaurants, check out my reviews)all within walking distance",,,,,,,,
c50612,s1,It is our Annual Group Meeting (L & E International Ltd),,,,,,,,
c50612,s2,We selected Sheraton Macau this time,,,,,,,,
c50612,s3,Overall service and hotel room is good,,,,,,,,
c50612,s4,One thing just want to highlight,,,,,,,,
c50612,s5,The conference room is not as good as our expected,,,,,,,,
c50612,s6,1,,,,,,,,
c50612,s7,One of the electric plug is not work,,,,,,,,
c50612,s8,2,,,,,,,,
c50612,s9,"TV cord do not connect with conference table, we need to move Notebook close the that plug (not user friendly)",,,,,,,,
c50612,s10,3,,,,,,,,
c50612,s11,We have more than 10 staffs in the meeting,,,,,,,,
c50612,s12,It seems tooooo small for us to work,,,,,,,,
c50613,s1,Recently stayed here for 2 nights,,,,,,,,
c50613,s2,The celebrated Sheraton Sweet Sleeper beds and roll-away bed certainly lives up to its reputation,,,,,,,,
c50613,s3,They were the most comfortable hotel beds we've experienced,,,,,,,,
c50613,s4,We were given an early 10:45am check-in instead of the normal 3pm without additional charges,,,,,,,,
c50613,s5,Check-in process at the SPG counter was fast and staff were very friendly and helpful,,,,,,,,
c50613,s6,Our room on the 24th floor of the Earth Tower was pleasant but the bathroom was a big disappointment,,,,,,,,
c50613,s7,The tower rail on the shower door practically fell off making it very inconvenient for us,,,,,,,,
c50613,s8,The bath amenities were one of the poorest for a hotel of Sheraton's international standing,,,,,,,,
c50613,s9,There was also no power socket for the hair-dryer in the bathroom,,,,,,,,
c50613,s10,"Although we check-in as 3 people, water and toiletries were_",,,,,,,,
c50614,s1,"The hotel was comfortable and staff was very helpful, but I need a bar! If I stay Sheraton, I'd expect a bar or a lounge to drink during taking a break from casino",,,,,,,,
c50614,s2,It was pity to have drinks with my friends from mini bar,,,,,,,,
c50614,s3,Doesn't Chinese casino work with alcohol?,,,,,,,,
c50615,s1,The hotel is huge and new however Cotai in general is like a tourist trap especially for those who is not familiar with Macao,,,,,,,,
c50615,s2,I have been to Macau 2x and stayed near the central and enjoyed my stay,,,,,,,,
c50615,s3,"My recent visit, we tried to stay in Cotai for a change but was a bit dissapointed as to the lack of things to do except for casino and shopping",,,,,,,,
c50615,s4,"To summarize my experience  Pros: -Beds are heavenly! -Rooms are of good size -Great views of the Venetian  -Huge Swim Pools (didn't use) -Easy access to shopping & other hotels in the vicinity (via footbridge)  Cons: - Feast (Lunch Buffet) - food was very bland, though there are numerous choices -Lack of things to do in the area -Location, a bit far from the City (though taxi's are cheap) -No food options in the area  This Sheraton_",,,,,,,,
c50616,s1,this hotel is very good and centrally located at the cotai strip macao,,,,,,,,
c50616,s2,Is really easy to find this hotel and the casino and mall is very good,,,,,,,,
c50616,s3,What the problem is only whe we check in the reception work is very slow and not care with the guest,,,,,,,,
c50616,s4,"really bad service in the reception and guest relationship, they really don't care about the guest",,,,,,,,
c50616,s5,Maybe is because the price of this hotel is cheaper than other in cotai strip,,,,,,,,
c50617,s1,The room was good and spacious,,,,,,,,
c50617,s2,"Apart from that, I might not choose this hotel again in the near future",,,,,,,,
c50617,s3,"In short, the room rate was bit expensive without breakfasts and Wi-fi included",,,,,,,,
c50617,s4,And the lobby was bit crowed and a lot of people were sitting in front of the casino area for Internet connection,,,,,,,,
c50617,s5,=,,,,,,,,
c50617,s6,,,,,,,,,
c50618,s1,Spent 2 nights at this hotel,,,,,,,,
c50618,s2,Location is good only if you come to Macau to gamble or spend your money on high-end shopping,,,,,,,,
c50618,s3,"A decent food-court located at the shopping mall below, not many choices but you can get seat more easily compared to the market street at Venetian",,,,,,,,
c50618,s4,"Best thing about this hotel is the spacious room, double-double bed for family with kids, big bathroom with separate shower and bathtub",,,,,,,,
c50618,s5,Worst thing is the crowd,,,,,,,,
c50618,s6,It took me about 1 hour to check-in queue and about 45 minutes to queue for a taxi,,,,,,,,
c50618,s7,"The crew were excellent, I really appreciate a check-out crew that allowed me to have a late check-out because of an urgent matter",,,,,,,,
c50619,s1,We wanted to choose Venetian but in the end opted for Sheraton instead,,,,,,,,
c50619,s2,We were kind of glad that we made this choice,,,,,,,,
c50619,s3,We went to Venetian on a Sat and it was like a market place,,,,,,,,
c50619,s4,Troupes of tour groups from mainland China,,,,,,,,
c50619,s5,Everyone is shouting and shuffling people around,,,,,,,,
c50619,s6,Escalators were jammed pack,,,,,,,,
c50619,s7,"From a supposedly classy place, it became a market place",,,,,,,,
c50619,s8,"Sheraton on the other hand was quieter, more refined crowds",,,,,,,,
c50619,s9,Sheraton room has 2 double beds but they were pretty small,,,,,,,,
c50619,s10,The curtains were old fashion considering this is one of the newer hotels at cotai strip,,,,,,,,
c50619,s11,"For the price paid, compared to other hotels, I think it's the most reasonable and affordable for a 5 star hotel",,,,,,,,
c50619,s12,We were given coupons to dine at Xin restaurant for breakfast for 2 nights,,,,,,,,
c50619,s13,The food option was not_,,,,,,,,
c50620,s1,"Nice, new(ish) and impressive enough in the lobby section, but unless you are an SPG member, be prepared to wait a while for check in",,,,,,,,
c50620,s2,"The locale is central enough, surrounded by other big casino/hotels - the likes of Galaxy, Venetian to name a few in this Taipa area",,,,,,,,
c50620,s3,The setup of the hotel is not so user friendly as there are very long corridors from one end of a floor to the other end,,,,,,,,
c50620,s4,"The rooms are clean enough, but lacks that opulence that one searches for the extra detail which made you feel that ""thoughts been put in to make the guest as comfortable as practicable""",,,,,,,,
c50620,s5,"I'm not rubbishing their affair, but it is just a bit lackluster",,,,,,,,
c50620,s6,"Rooms are acceptable size, not cramped, but lack the touches that make it a true 5 star hotel",,,,,,,,
c50620,s7,ie: lack of fruits/paper/refillable_,,,,,,,,
c50621,s1,"May be it was due to the high season, we found the service level not on par with other 5 star hotels in the area",,,,,,,,
c50621,s2,"As SPG member I got to check in at the special SPG counter which was nice, but the lady who served us seemed inexperienced and it took awhile for her to confirm our room and details",,,,,,,,
c50621,s3,Most of the other staff we met throughout our stay seemed cold and never greeted us,,,,,,,,
c50621,s4,We did enjoy our first stay at this hotel though,,,,,,,,
c50621,s5,The location is convenient with easy access to shuttles and taxis,,,,,,,,
c50621,s6,There's a covered footbridge which leads to the Venetian complex too,,,,,,,,
c50621,s7,The casino is relatively new and the staff there was professional,,,,,,,,
c50621,s8,We got a deluxe room which was large enough (especially the bathroom) and the bed was quite comfortable,,,,,,,,
c50621,s9,However just as I was looking forward_,,,,,,,,
c50622,s1,"A bit disappointed with the room! We had two joining rooms, to my surprise, I think the hotel was opened a year ago, the carpet in one of the rooms was torn and the door locks already looked tired!  The lobby was so busy that you would not like to sit at their lounge for a cup of tea!  Staff are very polite and helpful!",,,,,,,,
c50623,s1,We recently visited the Sheaton Macao hotel,,,,,,,,
c50623,s2,I found the hotel to be too big and confusing for people travelling with kids,,,,,,,,
c50623,s3,We are SPG members so we checked in at the SPG counters,,,,,,,,
c50623,s4,"We were the first in line, but waited at least one hour before the room keys were handed to us",,,,,,,,
c50623,s5,It's a long walk to the swimming pool and to restaurants,,,,,,,,
c50623,s6,We visited in the second week of December and the swimming pools were too small for the number of rooms and guests at the hotel,,,,,,,,
c50623,s7,I will only stay at Mandarin Oriental Macau if I go back and visit Macau again,,,,,,,,
c50624,s1,I find this hotel very confusing to commute around,,,,,,,,
c50624,s2,"Though it's confusing to go between the 2 towers, it's a nice hotel to do shopping and restaurants",,,,,,,,
c50624,s3,too many options to choose,,,,,,,,
c50624,s4,too difficult to find the right choice,,,,,,,,
c50624,s5,I presume Macau is like that too short at the same time too confusing,,,,,,,,
c50624,s6,keep surrounding the same place time again,,,,,,,,
c50625,s1,"The third time checking in this Hotel,  Funny issue no",,,,,,,,
c50625,s2,(1) :check in and check out still a problem,,,,,,,,
c50625,s3,"It was a bit better in the SPG special area but should still be expected to wait for 4-5 guests before your turn, which means at least 30 mins",,,,,,,,
c50625,s4,"Staffs are polite and tried to be helpful, but as some other viewers said, they are very busy with their computer keyboards, I had no idea why they need to type so much items",,,,,,,,
c50625,s5,Funny issue no,,,,,,,,
c50625,s6,"(2) :staff like to tell you that as they got more than 2000 rooms, guests are expected to wait in various areas, says, lift, breakfast, room service, even your call to the front desk",,,,,,,,
c50625,s7,"This "" We are a huge hotel with over 2000 rooms "" was heard most during my single night visit",,,,,,,,
c50625,s8,Funny issue no,,,,,,,,
c50625,s9,"(3): No matter how Non-chinese looking you are, hotel_",,,,,,,,
c50626,s1,"I am a passive and lazy reviewer, but if I write, it must be either superbe or shameful",,,,,,,,
c50626,s2,And this time is the latter,,,,,,,,
c50626,s3,"The experience is so bad that should warrant the attention of a Sheraton management who better cares enough about the hotel's reputation, especially when it can cause dishonest sales and promotion",,,,,,,,
c50626,s4,"We spent a bit more for the Club Lounge package under which guests are supposed to be entitled to a series of benefits including breakfast at the lounge, late check out, welcome drinks / food, a higher floor room etc",,,,,,,,
c50626,s5,"Freebies aside, I assume a hotel should understand that guests spend extra with a purpose - to have a relaxing, less disturbed stay",,,,,,,,
c50626,s6,But the truth is we suffered more than what we paid,,,,,,,,
c50626,s7,We couldn't get a seat at the Lounge during breakfast time two_,,,,,,,,
c50627,s1,"With almost 4,000 rooms, the hotel is expected to be busy during our visit from 19-21 Dec 13 with my husband and 4-year old child",,,,,,,,
c50627,s2,Arrived via ferry direct from HK airport,,,,,,,,
c50627,s3,"Took a quick 15 min cab ride, costing ~ USD 10 though there are free shuttle buses to hotels in the Sands Cotai area (Conrad Macao, Holiday Inn Macao, Sheraton)",,,,,,,,
c50627,s4,Service Check-in was relatively queue free but the reception basically lied and gave us a room with 2 beds instead of a king sized bed on a smoking floor even he specifically told us that our request isn't a problem,,,,,,,,
c50627,s5,Thank goodness we got to change to the room we wanted but it was unnecessary and extra work for no reason,,,,,,,,
c50627,s6,"Take note Sheraton!!  As expected, breakfast line was long at even 10am but it was breezy and service was speedy",,,,,,,,
c50627,s7,Room Dingy_,,,,,,,,
c50628,s1,"I went there early this month(december), and was surprised",,,,,,,,
c50628,s2,It is the worst hotel i have ever visited,,,,,,,,
c50628,s3,"First, let me tell you about my check inn experience, the lady at the desk was so rude she refused to even pass a smile and welcome",,,,,,,,
c50628,s4,I told her it was our first wedding anniversay and she did not even bother to wish us,,,,,,,,
c50628,s5,"Secondly, the whole place is such a mess",,,,,,,,
c50628,s6,so many people everywhere and no one is managing the crowd,,,,,,,,
c50628,s7,"Thirdly, the hotel staff is super rude, each time i went to their casino i was asked to show my passport,even after telling them i am staying there, they did not bother",,,,,,,,
c50628,s8,"Forth, every morning we had to stand in a queue for breakfast outside their restaurant",,,,,,,,
c50628,s9,that was disgusting,,,,,,,,
c50628,s10,"i mean a five star treating you like this ????? Fifth, the room service was utterly_",,,,,,,,
c50629,s1,Sheraton Macau is a mess with no system / no character what so ever,,,,,,,,
c50629,s2,They are so big that they cannot handle it,,,,,,,,
c50629,s3,Lets start with checkin,,,,,,,,
c50629,s4,"It is nightmare, if you are not SPG you have to stand in a really big queue",,,,,,,,
c50629,s5,"I was staying in a club room, and I could have checked in the club lounge, however, there was security on the ground floor who was very rude and did not allow me to go up and did not speak English, thus had to checkin in a big queue",,,,,,,,
c50629,s6,"In club I had made request for some special meal requirements, which was duly acknowledged, however when I went for first day during evening hours, my request was not fulfilled, and rather it became very embarrassing for me",,,,,,,,
c50629,s7,"After some harsh exchange of words, they treated me well for next 2 days",,,,,,,,
c50629,s8,On last day in breakfast the same story_,,,,,,,,
c50630,s1,"To be fair, the hotel was nice, the rooms were nice and very clean",,,,,,,,
c50630,s2,But my experience with Sheraton was scarred by my checking in and checking out process,,,,,,,,
c50630,s3,"First, I got an email in September to thank me for staying with Sheraton Macao and I was in shock",,,,,,,,
c50630,s4,"Did I book the wrong date? So I wrote to them and after two emails, it was due to a lapse in their system and they mistook another Audrey for me",,,,,,,,
c50630,s5,So I tot the episode is over,,,,,,,,
c50630,s6,"But in December, when I checked in at the counter",,,,,,,,
c50630,s7,the same boo-boo happened,,,,,,,,
c50630,s8,The staff took very long to verify all my details and it was not a smooth check in,,,,,,,,
c50630,s9,"The next day, when we checked out, I was not able to get back my 1000HKD deposit",,,,,,,,
c50630,s10,The staff insisted that I havent given any cash deposit and refused to give the deposit to me,,,,,,,,
c50630,s11,It was a_,,,,,,,,
c50631,s1,It was my first leg of a week long vacation,,,,,,,,
c50631,s2,The room size is considerably large and loads of amenities that are linked between hotels,,,,,,,,
c50631,s3,Many free shuttle buses to take,,,,,,,,
c50631,s4,I only wished that info is more made available to tourists once we step out of the ferry terminal,,,,,,,,
c50631,s5,Travel to the tourist attractions are mostly free and getting around is not difficult,,,,,,,,
c50632,s1,"Honestly, we didn't really enjoy the Cotai strip at all, shopping and gambling isn't our sort of holiday - we only went for one night to have a look around Cotai but really just to have access to old town Macau",,,,,,,,
c50632,s2,"Everything on Cotai is completely soul-less, distances to get anywhere are huge because everything has been built on a seriously large scale; maybe that helps with the volume of guests in high season - but I can only imagine it would be a horrendous place to be if everywhere was full",,,,,,,,
c50632,s3,"Off season, it was just like walking around a big almost empty shopping mall",,,,,,,,
c50632,s4,"Nothing new for casinos but they all seem to allow smoking which is just downright unpleasant for non-smokers like us, so we didn't stop to spend in any of them",,,,,,,,
c50633,s1,Spent two nights there as a weekend break to see the Taboo show as all other hotels nearby were fully booked for the boxing fight,,,,,,,,
c50633,s2,Hotel rooms are nice enough and service is ok,,,,,,,,
c50633,s3,Swimming pool and gym are hard to find if ok,,,,,,,,
c50633,s4,"However the lobby lost in the casino with throngs of people checking in and out at all times, smoking cigarettes inside and the rest, plus the very confusing layout of the ground floor and the long queues at breakfast are NOT ok for a 4 star hotel",,,,,,,,
c50633,s5,Thank god we had the SPG card so had some advantages and took refuge in City of Dreams across the road,,,,,,,,
c50633,s6,Would not stay here again,,,,,,,,
c50634,s1,18/11 checked in and front desk staff told me to show my credit card for deposit guarantee,,,,,,,,
c50634,s2,I have never signed any slip with my credit card,,,,,,,,
c50634,s3,Then checked out next day at express check out counter,,,,,,,,
c50634,s4,The staff just asked me if the minibar was used,,,,,,,,
c50634,s5,She did not tell me there was already a chargeable bill to my room,,,,,,,,
c50634,s6,"When I got back to HK, I found there was a bill of HK$380",,,,,,,,
c50634,s7,59 charged to my credit card by Sheraton Macao,,,,,,,,
c50634,s8,I was absolutely amazed and wondered how my credit card can be used w/o my authorised signature,,,,,,,,
c50634,s9,My card issuing bank suggested this might be a criminal fraud!  Then I sent an email to Sheraton Macao and Guest Service Manager replied it was a mistake made by F & B,,,,,,,,
c50634,s10,They confused my surname Wong with another guest and wrongly charged my credit card w/o any_,,,,,,,,
c50635,s1,"This hotel is managed very, very badly!!! We were sitting at the outside terrace of the Club Lounge on 4th floor at 21:30 and suddenly we got a shower with a very bad smell",,,,,,,,
c50635,s2,We turned around and had to find out that just behind us they were spraying the plans with chemicals,,,,,,,,
c50635,s3,"Despite the very bad smell they were not able to tell us with what kind of chemicals we have been sprayed, we've just been informed that it's 'fertilizer'",,,,,,,,
c50635,s4,This is absolutely not acceptable!!! A decent hotel management should be aware that the Club Lounge is open until 22:00 and therefore no chemical treatment should be done before 22:30,,,,,,,,
c50635,s5,But I'm honestly not very surprised about such a mismanagement at this hotel: after check in we came to our room and saw a lot of long black hair on the carpet and on the_,,,,,,,,
c50636,s1,"Despite the hotel and rooms being very nice, the food served at the pool cafe was by far the worst meal we have experienced in Asia",,,,,,,,
c50636,s2,The menu only has 6 items and we ordered 3 of them so it is fair to say that we had a fair representation of what was on offer,,,,,,,,
c50636,s3,The salads were caked in mayo and the 3 sandwiches we ordered were bordering on inedible,,,,,,,,
c50636,s4,"All deep fried till they were like rubber, on rock hard bread, and again covered in mayo",,,,,,,,
c50636,s5,"Unbelievably disappointing, we won't be back",,,,,,,,
c50637,s1,I found the location to be an issue,,,,,,,,
c50637,s2,"This hotel is based on a small strip with some other hotels (Venetian, Holiday Inn etc",,,,,,,,
c50637,s3,),,,,,,,,
c50637,s4,It is far away from the main strip with the really good/fun/well-established hotels (eg,,,,,,,,
c50637,s5,Grand Lisboa/MGM Grand/Wynn),,,,,,,,
c50637,s6,You need to get a taxi or shuttle bus to get to the other area,,,,,,,,
c50637,s7,The shuttle buses stop running at 11pm,,,,,,,,
c50637,s8,I found the choice of restaurants and bars limited and mediocre in and around the Sheraton,,,,,,,,
c50637,s9,"There was only one bar open after midnight in the hotel, and I was charged more for a Tsing Tao there than anywhere else on my week long trip to HK/Macau",,,,,,,,
c50637,s10,The room was comfortable and quiet,,,,,,,,
c50637,s11,The breakfast was good - a very wide range of options,,,,,,,,
c50637,s12,I was staying again I would stay in the central area of Macau,,,,,,,,
c50637,s13,"You have not only a much, much better_",,,,,,,,
c50638,s1,It was my second time staying in this hotel and would be my last time,,,,,,,,
c50638,s2,I have no complain on the hardware there but the staff were below the average,,,,,,,,
c50638,s3,1,,,,,,,,
c50638,s4,There were more than 10 used towels left on the floor of changing room of swimming pool,,,,,,,,
c50638,s5,2,,,,,,,,
c50638,s6,The staff in the restuarant have no intention to give way to you for breakfast but cut your way,,,,,,,,
c50638,s7,My table was next to their cupboard  and one of them placed the whole tray of folks and spoons on my table before they put them back to drawer,,,,,,,,
c50638,s8,3,,,,,,,,
c50638,s9,I used the express checkout and wrote down my email address for official receipt but i could get it after 2 weeks,,,,,,,,
c50638,s10,"I chased for SPG for another 2 weeks without any action done, until i gave up and went to Macau again",,,,,,,,
c50638,s11,I got it in person and SPG communciation sent me the receipt on the same day,,,,,,,,
c50638,s12,_,,,,,,,,
c50639,s1,"Personal experience only:  Good: Room is spacious and comfortable  Bad: comforter is a bit dirty (with hair)  No lobby at all, quite confusing and nobody escorted us to SPG area (I've never seen a 5 stars hotel with no sofa near check-in area) ( finally found sofa available in SPG area)  Not efficient during our check-in, took like 15 minus and speak only Mandarin (don't speak Cantonese)  Breakfast is quite far away from our room, like 10 minus walk, and we've waited like 10 minus outside the restaurant assigned and it took me another 5 minus for queuing up for a scramble egg  Staffs seem to be inexperience, took me about 5 calls to check for a TV broadcasting schedule, and there were misleading information provided  There is no convenience store like 7-11 nearby, the nearest_",,,,,,,,
c50640,s1,"First of all, I've never been to a 5 stars hotel that has no real lobby area, no sitting area, no sofa no nothing",,,,,,,,
c50640,s2,It is a huge building divided by a few hotels and casino area in the middle,,,,,,,,
c50640,s3,"Poor direction signs, very confusing with the shuttle bus get off and pick up service ( to different entrance and they are far apart!)  Very weird swimming pool layout",,,,,,,,
c50640,s4,"when we were there, the 8th floor pool was closed",,,,,,,,
c50640,s5,"so only the 4th floor one was open, very strange 7-8 tiny pools, only 2 were heated",,,,,,,,
c50640,s6,"others were cold as hell! Basically, they were just for a dip",,,,,,,,
c50640,s7,"However, the service was fine, friendly and helpful staff",,,,,,,,

c50640,s10,thumbs up to that! Shuttle bus from the ferry_,,,,,,,,
c50641,s1,Not a good place,,,,,,,,
c50641,s2,Concierge is always busy to pick up the phone,,,,,,,,
c50641,s3,Casino dealers cannot speak a word of English and don't follow requests appropriately,,,,,,,,
c50641,s4,This hotel has a long way to go to meet international standard of a quality hotel,,,,,,,,
c50641,s5,Room seems like it was renovated in the 90s,,,,,,,,
c50642,s1,Stayed in Oct 2013 as couple,,,,,,,,
c50642,s2,"We spent a weekend getaway with Sheraton Macao, the property is pretty new, and the room is up to the normal Sheraton standard, but not a superb!  During the check-in, there's no SPG line, no matter whats your grading is, and there's loads of people at check in, and whatever we asked the staff at check-in, he wasn't quite listening",,,,,,,,
c50642,s3,"Sheraton featured the 3 impressive outdoor swimming pools, that 2 of them are warm as 28 degree",,,,,,,,
c50642,s4,"However, we found out that the 3 impressive outdoor swimming pools are split into smaller pools, like the one on 8th floor is split into 4 small pools, and on 4th floor, split into alot of pools",,,,,,,,
c50642,s5,"and out of the pools, only 2 small pools are warmed, which is very disappointing",,,,,,,,
c50642,s6,"BTW, please make sure you wear makeup_",,,,,,,,
c50643,s1,We stayed at the Presidental Suite to celebrate my father's birthday but lot of the equipment is just decorative and serve no functional purpose,,,,,,,,
c50643,s2,"There is a karaoke room in the suite but the system doesn't work, there are TVs in the bathrooms and they don't work",,,,,,,,
c50643,s3,There is a massage room but they don't offer in room massage service,,,,,,,,
c50643,s4,The phone doesn't work and there are no pay per view movies even though they installed an inbuilt Bose surround sound system with a 57 inches TV inside the suite,,,,,,,,
c50643,s5,The rooms are room but thy don't have family board games ready for rent even though they advertise themselves as a family friendly hotel,,,,,,,,
c50643,s6,"What's worse, we made all these notifications to our so called butler (which they advertise they would have but is actually non existent) but they_",,,,,,,,
c50644,s1,I stayed here with a friend for one night when we went to Macau for a concert,,,,,,,,
c50644,s2,"While I'm impressed with the room, everything else seems to have gone downhill from there",,,,,,,,
c50644,s3,"We were told at reception that we get free wi-fi service in our room, but apparently that wasn't the case, as we keep getting this pop-up message saying we need to pay in order to use the wi-fi",,,,,,,,
c50644,s4,"Needless to say, we couldn't use wi-fi during our stay at the hotel",,,,,,,,
c50644,s5,Not something I expected from a 5-star hotel,,,,,,,,
c50644,s6,Ordering room service was another disaster,,,,,,,,
c50644,s7,"They told us our food would arrive within 40 minutes after we placed the order, but we had to wait for over an hour",,,,,,,,
c50644,s8,"When we call to check, the staff acted as if he did not even receive our order in the first place (then hung up on us)",,,,,,,,
c50644,s9,We finally had to call_,,,,,,,,
c50645,s1,Sheraton is a new hotel just opened last year along with Conrad and Holiday Inn Cotai Centre,,,,,,,,
c50645,s2,"Since I'm a SPG member and also it claimed that it has the largest number of rooms (close to 4,000?), so I chose to stay at Sheraton for an experience",,,,,,,,
c50645,s3,"The room rate per night is quite expensive, about HK$1,600 including tax without breakfast and it's already a promotional rate",,,,,,,,
c50645,s4,"OK, it's like other 5 star hotels in Macao, they have a nice & big lobby area and the shopping mall is connected to Conrad and Holiday Inn",,,,,,,,
c50645,s5,"Of course, there's a casino down there too",,,,,,,,
c50645,s6,"When I checked in, the front desk staff spoke to me in Putonghua",,,,,,,,
c50645,s7,"I talked to him in Cantonese, but he didn't understand and then I talked to him in English, but he's english is poor",,,,,,,,
c50645,s8,My feeling is the hotel just prepare for the_,,,,,,,,
c50646,s1,I am SPG member and am always satisfied with this hotel group except for Sheraton Macao! It was our anniversary trip which we have advised the hotel and they confirmed by e-mail there'll be special arrangement,,,,,,,,
c50646,s2,"It turned out nothing was done! We checked in with a Chinese staff, she mentioned they were aware of our anniversary, I heard she called housekeeping then we were told to wait for at least half an hour more to let them prepare the room",,,,,,,,
c50646,s3,"We came back an hour later and approached another Philippine staff to get the room keys, he seemed not welcoming with no smile",,,,,,,,
c50646,s4,We went up to the room expecting something different from the normal guest room,,,,,,,,
c50646,s5,"Surprisingly, there is nothing prepared! Why do we have to wait then? Called the front desk, they did apologized and sent us a_",,,,,,,,
c50647,s1,My husband and I passed five days in this hotel,,,,,,,,
c50647,s2,Rooms are correct,,,,,,,,
c50647,s3,Except that it is freezing inside if you dont turn off the aircon,,,,,,,,
c50647,s4,Pools are pretty good except that most of the time it is crowded by childrens,,,,,,,,
c50647,s5,wifi: well if you dont pay too bad for you,,,,,,,,
c50647,s6,since all the hotels and casinos in this areas are linked you have no chance to get it for free,,,,,,,,
c50647,s7,Location is ok too,,,,,,,,
c50647,s8,well deserved by the shuttles,,,,,,,,
c50647,s9,Honestly since all the hotels are connected you can pass easily from one hotel to an other and they all look exactly the same,,,,,,,,
c50647,s10,"All huge ,cold as death, same exact casinos, same restaurants",,,,,,,,
c50647,s11,concierge desk is pretty helpful usually and keen to help,,,,,,,,
c50648,s1,I initially booked one night in this hotel based on feedbacks I read on trip advisor,,,,,,,,
c50648,s2,What a disappointment,,,,,,,,
c50648,s3,The staff was rude and not professional at all,,,,,,,,
c50648,s4,We decided to book an extra night because of the typhoon and my daughter was booking online for us at 12:30pm but the staff forced us to check out at 12:30 sharp (already considered as late check out!!) and we had to drag all our luggage out even though we told them that we will be staying an additional night and payment was in process,,,,,,,,
c50648,s5,"After 5 min waiting at the lobby, the staff informed us that payment was validated and we can drag back our luggage back to our room",,,,,,,,
c50648,s6,This was really ridiculous and we were really unhappy about that,,,,,,,,
c50648,s7,They didn't even apologize for making us wait,,,,,,,,
c50648,s8,"When we checked out, I forgot my charger in_",,,,,,,,
c50649,s1,We decided to go for a short family weekend to Macau,,,,,,,,
c50649,s2,The Sheraton Macau offered a nice deal which I could pay off by SPG points,,,,,,,,
c50649,s3,Usually we stay at the Westin as it still is (even though a bit outdated) a very nice family oriented beach resort,,,,,,,,
c50649,s4,We checked the website of the Sheraton and were quiet impressed of the pool area especially my daughter was highly enthusiastic,,,,,,,,
c50649,s5,"Once we checked in, I was welcomed by a nice german manager to the ""world biggest sheraton"" Well, when I heard that I was a little bit concerned",,,,,,,,
c50649,s6,"Unfortunately, my concerns turned out to be correct",,,,,,,,
c50649,s7,Matter of fact the pool area is dedicated for people which cannot swim,,,,,,,,
c50649,s8,None of the pools was deeper than 1,,,,,,,,
c50649,s9,3 metres,,,,,,,,
c50649,s10,"Moreover my daughter was disappointed about the lack of some poolf fun such as water slides,_",,,,,,,,
c50650,s1,This is the first visit to their pool area as I am going with my nephew but adult can't really swim as most of them were in irregular shapes,,,,,,,,
c50650,s2,"Also when you walk with you bare feet, you just felt it was not clean properly",,,,,,,,
c50650,s3,My newphew got Dermatosis after 3 day trip,,,,,,,,
c50650,s4,Poor him!,,,,,,,,
c50651,s1,"Before the expansion, I really regarded this hotel high in quality of service, but with the expansion of a new tower, the quality of service is far far behind the expansion",,,,,,,,
c50651,s2,"Being a SPG member, I really cannot sense any special treatment I enjoy the IHG member",,,,,,,,
c50651,s3,"Before, early check-in was allowed with one to two hour late check out",,,,,,,,
c50651,s4,"Now, definitely not",,,,,,,,
c50651,s5,"When I called the cocinerage for booking a restaurant through the operator, I was told they were too busy to pick up my call",,,,,,,,
c50651,s6,"Minutes later, a lady asked me the details of my booking",,,,,,,,
c50651,s7,"Then minutes later, she simply told me that she could not book successfully for no one picked up her call",,,,,,,,
c50651,s8,She promised to call me later,,,,,,,,
c50651,s9,"Yet, hours later, near 4:30 p",,,,,,,,
c50651,s10,m,,,,,,,,
c50651,s11,", no call from the concierage, then I called the operator to talk to_",,,,,,,,
c50652,s1,We have travelled throughout mainland China and are now in Macao,,,,,,,,
c50652,s2,The checkin took 1 hour and the rooms we booked online 2 months ago were not ready,,,,,,,,
c50652,s3,Room service meals took 40 minutes so once again have to say Sheraton does not meet our service expectations,,,,,,,,
c50652,s4,beds are comfortable and well appointed,,,,,,,,
c50652,s5,Think I will be giving Sheraton a miss in future,,,,,,,,
c50653,s1,"Stayed here for 5 nights, booked 3 rooms",,,,,,,,
c50653,s2,"So I've seen their Executive suite (upgraded), the normal deluxe? room and the Family suite",,,,,,,,
c50653,s3,"We were very impressed on the first day, right from the airport transfer, to the amazing rooms",,,,,,,,
c50653,s4,"During the stay, we got less impressed with the service until finally, some of us got locked out in the pool",,,,,,,,
c50653,s5,Good: - Family suite is actually 2 identical rooms combined,,,,,,,,
c50653,s6,"On 1 side is the kids room with Wii games (Madagascar only), double-decker beds (which got the kids so excited until they realised the upper deck's bed was hard), play area, and yes - a bathroom all by themselves",,,,,,,,
c50653,s7,"The space and the extras (kids bath set, slippers, robes) made it worthwhile",,,,,,,,
c50653,s8,The other side will be the parents room,,,,,,,,
c50653,s9,The design was such that you could close the_,,,,,,,,
c50654,s1,Hotel/Room: A new hotel in Macau equipped with comprehensive room facilities,,,,,,,,
c50654,s2,Room is clean and tidy Easy to access by taking free Shuttle Bus nearby Pier,,,,,,,,
c50654,s3,Hotel provides free breakfast,,,,,,,,
c50654,s4,I must to say that the food provided satisfied different people from different nationality,,,,,,,,
c50654,s5,Good Job!  The hotel is too crowded,,,,,,,,
c50654,s6,Everywhere is people,,,,,,,,
c50654,s7,No matter doing check in/check out,,,,,,,,
c50655,s1,The stay in the hotel in Aug proved to be fruitful,,,,,,,,
c50655,s2,"The room was proper cleaned up, bathroom was excellent just few things were missing such as personalized service, Luggage pick up",,,,,,,,
c50655,s3,"We had to take our luggage to our rooms personally, no porter service was provided",,,,,,,,
c50655,s4,The bathroom was extraordinary excellent and had shower in it with wall as well as hand,,,,,,,,
c50655,s5,which is quite comfortable and missing in many other hotels,,,,,,,,
c50655,s6,Hotel is quite big and have good ambience,,,,,,,,
c50656,s1,I had a very brief stay at Macau and was very disappointed at the service provided by the hotel,,,,,,,,
c50656,s2,"The room facility was barely a three-star, though the hotel claimed that it is a 4",,,,,,,,
c50656,s3,5 star,,,,,,,,
c50656,s4,"This asides, my biggest issue is with their concierge",,,,,,,,
c50656,s5,The staffs were not helpful at all when I asked to purchase boat tickets to get to HK airport,,,,,,,,
c50656,s6,They were very stubborn and suggested me take the shuttle 2 hours before the boat departure time,,,,,,,,
c50656,s7,"I questioned whether I needed to prepare that much time in advance, but she insisted",,,,,,,,
c50656,s8,I took her advice and waited at the port for 1,,,,,,,,
c50656,s9,5 hours,,,,,,,,
c50656,s10,I think they should provide more realistic suggestion to tourists as it's their job to provide guests with a good travel experience,,,,,,,,
c50656,s11,"Maybe it is just Macau style, but I am very unhappy about the stay there",,,,,,,,
c50657,s1,We stayed here for one night so we could see a show,,,,,,,,
c50657,s2,Location was good,,,,,,,,
c50657,s3,We were offered an upgrade for the room and breakfast included,,,,,,,,
c50657,s4,"The room itself was very good but hotel guests obviously don't look out of the window! The view was over a lot of building rubble! The breakfast was, in a word - terrible! We ended up going out to a coffee shop",,,,,,,,
c50657,s5,If you want to go to the casino and see a show then the hotel is fine abd rhe front desk staff tried to be very helpful,,,,,,,,
c50657,s6,Just don't  have breakfast!,,,,,,,,
c50658,s1,A nice and clean hotel but possibly not 5 star,,,,,,,,
c50658,s2,It's felt like a 1km walk from the coach drop off to the reception desk and another 1km walk to the room,,,,,,,,
c50658,s3,Maybe OK if you have no luggage but exhausting with three cases,,,,,,,,
c50658,s4,The room view on the upper floors over Cotai Strip are fantastic,,,,,,,,
c50658,s5,The check in at 3pm and check out at 11am make this hotel a sleep place only if staying one day,,,,,,,,
c50658,s6,The Italian restaurant on the ground floor has great food and wine at reasonable prices,,,,,,,,
c50659,s1,We stayed in this hotel for vacation during the summer,,,,,,,,
c50659,s2,Some points that people may consider before making the choice:  1) Very small and crowded swimming pool,,,,,,,,
c50659,s3,2) No lifeguard on duty at the swimming pool,,,,,,,,
c50659,s4,This is stated on the stainless steel signage in the swimming pool area,,,,,,,,
c50659,s5,3) we have complimentary buffet breakfast provided at G/F restaurant,,,,,,,,
c50659,s6,"However, there was too many people queuing up even at 10:10am ( the breakfast time will end at 10:30 am), we were led by the restaurant manager to have breakfast at 4/F function room",,,,,,,,
c50659,s7,"No need to queue up there, but the variety of food choice are much less than the ordinary restaurant",,,,,,,,
c50659,s8,4) The hotel room is cozy and clean,,,,,,,,
c50659,s9,The bed is also comfortable,,,,,,,,
c50660,s1,The hotel was packed when I arrived,,,,,,,,
c50660,s2,The check in queue snaked all over the reception area,,,,,,,,
c50660,s3,Since I had booked the club room I hoped to skip this queue and check in at the club level,,,,,,,,
c50660,s4,Advice given by the staff was confusing,,,,,,,,
c50660,s5,They have two towers and the staff who told me the floor failed to mention this,,,,,,,,
c50660,s6,"Of course I had to go to the wrong tower and it took quite a while to get to the club floor, lugging my big suitcase too",,,,,,,,
c50660,s7,Checking in at the club floor took quite a while,,,,,,,,
c50660,s8,Soft drinks were available but no hot drinks! I was told hot drinks would only be available from 11 o'clock,,,,,,,,
c50660,s9,I think this is the first time a club lounge offers no hot drinks outside scheduled time,,,,,,,,
c50660,s10,"After checking in, there was no one to show me to the lifts to my room",,,,,,,,
c50660,s11,Again I had to lugged my bag around_,,,,,,,,
c50661,s1,first impression was poor with the hotel check in being a mere 5 metres from the casino floor and the smell of smoke was very strong coming from the gaming area,,,,,,,,
c50661,s2,If you're not coming to Macau to gamble i would suggest to choose somewhere other than here,,,,,,,,
c50661,s3,On the plus side even the standard rooms are massive and the beds are super comfortable and with the complete blackout curtains and soundproof walls it was easy to get a peaceful nights sleep,,,,,,,,
c50661,s4,Try to request a view overlooking Cotai as the view at the back of the hotel overlooks a desolate swamp and is a little depressing,,,,,,,,
c50661,s5,Also be mindful there are limited good western food options outside of the set breakfast/lunch/dinner times,,,,,,,,
c50662,s1,"This Hotel is decorated in 'Earth'  tones, which has been fashionable in the hotel industry in the last few years",,,,,,,,
c50662,s2,All that brown makes the hotel very dull looking and it would seem contributes to the  bored looks on the face of the staff,,,,,,,,
c50662,s3,The Feast restaurant at 3,,,,,,,,
c50662,s4,"00 pm took up to 40 minutes to serve me and my friends with Prawns Piri Piri, a Beef burger a Hot Dog",,,,,,,,
c50662,s5,We were the only 3 people in the restaurant,,,,,,,,
c50662,s6,"My friend thought that her massage at the Spa was excellent  We were on a one night package, in a standard room",,,,,,,,
c50662,s7,Very average,,,,,,,,
c50662,s8,I would not visit again,,,,,,,,
c50663,s1,"First off, when you walk in, all you smell is cigarettes",,,,,,,,
c50663,s2,It's ok to smoke in the casinos and the casino is the forefront if the lobby,,,,,,,,
c50663,s3,The lobby feels tiny because it wraps around the casino,,,,,,,,
c50663,s4,It's hard to find where to enter to check in,,,,,,,,
c50663,s5,Hoards of other mainland chinese block the entrance to the check I'm entrance,,,,,,,,
c50663,s6,There was a worker standing there and could see I was looking for something but completely ignored me,,,,,,,,
c50663,s7,The front desk check in was easy and painless,,,,,,,,
c50663,s8,"When I asked about wifi in the room, they said pay $30 an hour or you can have it for the whole day for $120",,,,,,,,
c50663,s9,That was a huge disappointment,,,,,,,,
c50663,s10,The next morning we awoke to a tiny dead cockroach on our sheets,,,,,,,,
c50663,s11,I was furious,,,,,,,,
c50663,s12,"When I brought it up to the staff, they said it happens and would gladly switch rooms for us",,,,,,,,
c50663,s13,_,,,,,,,,
c50664,s1,This was the first time I stayed in this hotel for two nights,,,,,,,,
c50664,s2,"But my experience was when I entered the room, the size and view of room were not totally disappointed",,,,,,,,
c50664,s3,Extra charge for wifi in the room was required,,,,,,,,
c50664,s4,I will not recommend my friends or relative to stay in this hotel,,,,,,,,
c50664,s5,Since another hotel in macau with similar charges but better services and view than here,,,,,,,,
c50665,s1,"This is our first stay in Sheraton Macau, was wow by the room as we were stayed in the Executive Suite",,,,,,,,
c50665,s2,The room is great and amazing,,,,,,,,
c50665,s3,Very huge and it makes us  feel very comfortable during our 2 nights stay,,,,,,,,
c50665,s4,"I checked in in the noon, was out for dinner but when I returned to my room my sofa bed is not fixed yet",,,,,,,,
c50665,s5,As I was told it will be fixed soon right after I left the room,,,,,,,,
c50665,s6,Not to mention the bathroom was extremely fun and modern,,,,,,,,
c50665,s7,"A nice bathroom that we had, only cons is there isn't any hot water when we are getting our  shower",,,,,,,,
c50665,s8,"Breakfast on the last day was ok, we were queuing for the breakfast, until it was our turn the manager asked us whether our room are included with breakfast? and I said no",,,,,,,,
c50665,s9,"So he looked at me and said, breakfast needs to pay if you want to_",,,,,,,,
c50666,s1,The Sheraton is sadly poorly organized with unmotivated staff and lack of basic training,,,,,,,,
c50666,s2,Maybe it's the gambling environment that makes all staff so disinterested and slow to act,,,,,,,,
c50666,s3,A very disappointing experience for the normally fabulous Sheraton chain,,,,,,,,
c50667,s1,"Brand new Sheraton, good location, nicely done rooms, atmosphere was good, nice hotel, but",,,,,,,,
c50667,s2,I was extremely disappointed by the breakfast buffet,,,,,,,,
c50667,s3,"I know, I know it's free, included with the room so I shouldn't complain, what can you expect from a free service",,,,,,,,
c50667,s4,"Well, I expect better",,,,,,,,
c50667,s5,I travel a lot and normally stay at a competing chain's hotels but they don't have a property in Macao yet,,,,,,,,
c50667,s6,"So, I booked at Sheraton expecting similar level of service",,,,,,,,
c50667,s7,The problem was just a lack of choices,,,,,,,,
c50667,s8,"They had waffles but only syrup for toppings, limited breads & salad choices and the bacon looked like a pile of undercooked soggy noodles",,,,,,,,
c50667,s9,Bacon should be crispy for heaven's sake!  I ate a plate of fruit and left,,,,,,,,
c50667,s10,This morning I chose to skip it altogether,,,,,,,,
c50667,s11,For me the breakfast_,,,,,,,,
c50668,s1,"I am a loyal customers with Sheraton and SPG guest, and have been staying in Sheraton hotels for more than 50 times around the world",,,,,,,,
c50668,s2,"However, our last two visits with Macau Sheraton were an unpleasant stay for us",,,,,,,,
c50668,s3,"Firstly, due to the uneven air-conditioning in room, I wanna to request for an extra blanket, however, I was told that it was not available and even I requested to pay for the service but in vain",,,,,,,,
c50668,s4,"In addition, I stayed with my room for 2 nights, however, the housekeeping rang the room bell twice to wake me up at 10:00 a",,,,,,,,
c50668,s5,m,,,,,,,,
c50668,s6,"on the 1st morning for cleaning up, a 2-star service?     No extra toilet paper in washroom and  should I call room-services to request for urgent assistance?",,,,,,,,
c50669,s1,"We were very excited about the DreamWorks holiday advertised and booked a family suite and unluckily, the weather was stormy and we arrived during Typhoon 8",,,,,,,,
c50669,s2,"While the hotel was not responsible for the weather, the entire experience was far below average and where do I start?   The room was fun for the kids but that was about the only good thing about this entire stay",,,,,,,,
c50669,s3,"Service was dismal and everywhere, staff seemed reluctant to help, disinterested and overworked",,,,,,,,
c50669,s4,"Towels and amenities were not replenished daily; one day we were missing hand towels, another day, there was no bath mat",,,,,,,,
c50669,s5,We have family holidays in Macau often and we usually stay at the Galaxy,,,,,,,,
c50669,s6,"After this experience, we will steer clear of Cotai",,,,,,,,
c50669,s7,"I never appreciated the design, layout and service at Galaxy as much_",,,,,,,,
c50670,s1,"Having stayed in Macau numerous times, I can say that this hotel falls short",,,,,,,,
c50670,s2,This hotel opened up less than a year ago so the standards should be high being that Macau is continuously growing becoming more competitive,,,,,,,,
c50670,s3,"First off, I was put off by the fact that the wifi here is not free",,,,,,,,
c50670,s4,Free in the lobby but you have to pay in the rooms,,,,,,,,
c50670,s5,$30 an hour or $120 a day,,,,,,,,
c50670,s6,Quite ridiculous,,,,,,,,
c50670,s7,"So needless to say, it looks like waves of hoarders in the lobby",,,,,,,,
c50670,s8,"They sit wherever there is room to, which is already limited, with their faces glued to their phones taking advantage of the free wifi",,,,,,,,
c50670,s9,So no sitting room in the hotel,,,,,,,,
c50670,s10,This leads to the next turn off:  The lobby is set up oddly,,,,,,,,
c50670,s11,"The casino is dead center so the rest of the hotel sort of wraps around it, leaving a narrow walkway that_",,,,,,,,
c50671,s1,"the hotel offers quite decent value for money, although do not take the club lounge benefits, as there are no benefits and really not worth the extra money",,,,,,,,
c50671,s2,"rooms are decent size, clean and has all you need for a couple of nights",,,,,,,,
c50671,s3,The hotel is part of the Sands Cotai complex and it's easy to walk around and get to adjacent City of Dreams and Venetian / Four Seasons,,,,,,,,
c50671,s4,There is a casino in the hotel which is pretty average too,,,,,,,,
c50671,s5,It was August and must have been peak season school holidays - the place was so busy with huge tour groups and kids everywhere,,,,,,,,
c50671,s6,"Breakfast was a real free for all and due to the amount of people, a lot of the dishes were quite often empty",,,,,,,,
c50671,s7,Worst egg chef I've come across,,,,,,,,
c50671,s8,Food is very average to say the least,,,,,,,,
c50672,s1,"Extract from Sheraton Macao website: ""For adults wanting a break from the cheery chirping of children, the tranquil Tiki Pool is the place to go",,,,,,,,
c50672,s2,The adults-only pool is bordered by sun lounges and 18 private cabanas with fans and daybeds and peers spectacularly over the buzzing Cotai Strip,,,,,,,,
c50672,s3,""" I need a short breaks & i picked Sheraton Macao for 3D2N due to there's a ADULT ONLY swimmig pool at 8/F, the Tiki Pool, according to their webite",,,,,,,,
c50672,s4,"Understand it is summertime, many families will go Macau for a short trip & i am travel alone who is looking for relaxation, so i think Sheraton is perfect for me even the ROOM ONLY costs HKD1",,,,,,,,
c50672,s5,5k+ per night under early booking,,,,,,,,
c50672,s6,"After check in, i check with the front desk on the opening hours for the adult only swimming pool",,,,,,,,
c50672,s7,The staff at the_,,,,,,,,
c50673,s1,Checked in late one rainy night,,,,,,,,
c50673,s2,"The lobby is a zoo, Grand Central Station is calm compared to this place",,,,,,,,
c50673,s3,Staff was wonderful,,,,,,,,
c50673,s4,Room was without faults,,,,,,,,
c50673,s5,Went to the Italian restaurant,,,,,,,,
c50673,s6,It was wonderful! Breakfast was a zoo as well,,,,,,,,
c50674,s1,This hotel is the worst hotel with service compared in the other sheaton hotel in different country i have been lived,,,,,,,,
c50674,s2,My friends and I lived in this hotel for 3 nights today,,,,,,,,
c50674,s3,We just checked out today,,,,,,,,
c50674,s4,Our Room no,,,,,,,,
c50674,s5,23139,,,,,,,,
c50674,s6,in earth building,,,,,,,,
c50674,s7,"There are some truth experiences happened to us for your refrence, you have to know before you stay",,,,,,,,
c50674,s8,1,,,,,,,,
c50674,s9,"First, the check in service is very slowly, according the hotel manager speaking, there are more than 3000 guests live in high season, they cannot help about it",,,,,,,,
c50674,s10,"According my understanding, as a five stars hotel, it is NOT a reason to make your customer keep in line for 20-30 min",,,,,,,,
c50674,s11,2,,,,,,,,
c50674,s12,"There are bag carrier services after check in, but not for all the people due to many guests",,,,,,,,
c50674,s13,I thought it is basic service for a Sheaton standard,,,,,,,,
c50674,s14,3,,,,,,,,
c50674,s15,The bed is too_,,,,,,,,
c50675,s1,You stayed at the family suite with 2 young children while they have the big summer Dreamworks promotion,,,,,,,,
c50675,s2,"The rooms are perfect for families, it has bunk bed, tv and games",,,,,,,,
c50675,s3,Kids enjoyed it a lot,,,,,,,,
c50675,s4,"When we arrived, front desk staff accommodated us with early check in",,,,,,,,
c50675,s5,Front desk staff needs to be more familiar with the own promotion package,,,,,,,,
c50675,s6,"I was missing free wifi, qube tickets and breakfast for the children",,,,,,,,
c50675,s7,Their also comes with a welcome packet for kids,,,,,,,,
c50675,s8,"Unfortunately, they kept telling me only one per room",,,,,,,,
c50675,s9,"I have 2 kids, are they supposed to fight for it? After I talked to the staff on the phone, they sent another staff to bring us another welcome packet and qube tickets",,,,,,,,
c50675,s10,I asked the about the activities for kids when they gave me the promotion card,,,,,,,,
c50675,s11,It was very confusing,,,,,,,,
c50675,s12,_,,,,,,,,
c50676,s1,"Hotel is clean and modern, very convenient sitting amongst the Sand's Cotai complex",,,,,,,,
c50676,s2,"Shops, restaurants and of course, the casino",,,,,,,,
c50676,s3,"It is a big hotel, and span's across two towers",,,,,,,,
c50676,s4,"Check-in was slow, as an SPG member since 1999, it was the first time I had to wait 15 mins in queue to actually check in",,,,,,,,
c50676,s5,"Arrived around 4 pm on a Friday, if that makes a difference",,,,,,,,
c50676,s6,"They never tell you  that there are two lobbies to check in, which could have made it easier",,,,,,,,
c50676,s7,"Also, the directions to your room are not clear, particularly if you come off the ferry bus at the back of the building you need to walk through the arcade for quite a distance to find the lift lobby",,,,,,,,
c50676,s8,"My only negative feedback here is the breakfast, I was allocated to the Caspian Room on the 4th floor, which is a function_",,,,,,,,
c50677,s1,"Spent a night with the Executive Suite which was nice, well-equipped and relaxing",,,,,,,,
c50677,s2,NO argument on facilities and provisions as they are the first class,,,,,,,,
c50677,s3,"However, services are the issues, especially for the club lounge and spa reception",,,,,,,,
c50677,s4,The club lounge is not that private as it is like a restaurant serving big crowd of people during breakfast and cocktail,,,,,,,,
c50677,s5,Not the type of privacy you could find normally on a E Floor,,,,,,,,
c50677,s6,The individual quality of staff there need improvement,,,,,,,,
c50677,s7,Spa treatment was good but the greetings of reception was poor,,,,,,,,
c50677,s8,Time to improve,,,,,,,,
c50678,s1,We booked this Hotel just for the family suite which included a child bed and wii,,,,,,,,
c50678,s2,"Overall, the Hotel is spectacular and the staff is awesome",,,,,,,,
c50678,s3,There are 2 reasons why I would rate this Hotel average and not excellent:  1,,,,,,,,
c50678,s4,Had a very bad time getting to the Hotel,,,,,,,,
c50678,s5,"Once you get out of the ferry terminal, you can see signs and people from almost every Hotel in Macau",,,,,,,,
c50678,s6,What you could not see is a sign of Hotel Sheraton,,,,,,,,
c50678,s7,Carrying luggage up and down to find the right shuttle was a real pain,,,,,,,,
c50678,s8,The management should do something about this,,,,,,,,
c50678,s9,2,,,,,,,,
c50678,s10,Bars and Restaurants are not open late night,,,,,,,,
c50678,s11,We came back at around 2 AM after watching the IIFA awards and we could not find a place to eat,,,,,,,,
c50678,s12,Restaurants in the casino are open till late but not for 24 hours,,,,,,,,
c50678,s13,Very difficult to have a quick snack_,,,,,,,,
c50679,s1,"At the time of writing this review, after midnight, a pool side private party in the Sheraton still continue and the noisy music keep my family, staying on the 17th floor, awake including my eight months old baby",,,,,,,,
c50679,s2,so this is the behaviour of Sheraton which sacrifices the interest of its guest and could not offer them a good night sleep,,,,,,,,
c50680,s1,"Built as part of Sand's latest Cotai Central property, this place will sure awe it's guests at first glance",,,,,,,,
c50680,s2,Tropical lobby and luxury conference/expo facilities,,,,,,,,
c50680,s3,"Being a Macau resort, luxury furnishing and deluxe amenities are expected and are delivered at this hotel",,,,,,,,
c50680,s4,"This place takes loyalty very seriously, they have a mezzanine lobby, just for its SPG members, they get a special keycard and personalised welcome",,,,,,,,
c50680,s5,"And of course, their casino VIPs get the same",,,,,,,,
c50680,s6,"Having stayed at this hotel quite a few times, I understand how some reviewers experienced a 5 star stay and some who would have regretted their choices",,,,,,,,
c50680,s7,"It all depends on the staff you meet, they can become very inconsistent",,,,,,,,
c50680,s8,"When it's busy and lots of casino guests are checking in, you may be greeted by staff with an_",,,,,,,,
c50681,s1,Upon check in: We stayed at this hotel due to Venetian was fully book during my travelling period,,,,,,,,
c50681,s2,"As my business conference was at Venetian, i decided to book this hotel room from their website since it was located just opposite Venetian",,,,,,,,
c50681,s3,"Upon check in, i was referred to their normal check in counter to wait for my turn even i was SPG member",,,,,,,,
c50681,s4,"(the staff told me ""it was the same"")",,,,,,,,
c50681,s5,"For your information, the Starwood Preferred Guest check-in counter has nice sofa and complimentary drink for our partner or family to sit down comfortably while waiting for check in procedure to complete",,,,,,,,
c50681,s6,This is absolutely difference from standing blindly waiting along the queue for check in ya,,,,,,,,
c50681,s7,The first impression for Sheraton Macau Cotai is not good already,,,,,,,,
c50681,s8,Room: We had the second last room_,,,,,,,,
c50682,s1,Was allocated room in the new Earth Tower which was only opened in Jan 2013,,,,,,,,
c50682,s2,Quick check-in and hassle-free check-out,,,,,,,,
c50682,s3,Large and spacious bathroom with both bathtub and standing shower,,,,,,,,
c50682,s4,Bed is large and comfortable,,,,,,,,
c50682,s5,Free internet is available only at the hotel lobby,,,,,,,,
c50682,s6,Links conveniently to The Venetian via the covered overhead bridge,,,,,,,,
c50682,s7,"Breakfast is included in the package, but we did not eat in, so could not comment on in",,,,,,,,
c50683,s1,Family of two adults and two young kids stayed for one night,,,,,,,,
c50683,s2,Big hotel in cotai area close to other hotels and casinos,,,,,,,,
c50683,s3,Seems that Sheraton pools were all closed except for one small pool,,,,,,,,
c50683,s4,Not good,,,,,,,,
c50683,s5,Kids wanted to swim but it was just too crowded which takes away from the enjoyment,,,,,,,,
c50683,s6,For a weeknight we paid quite a bit,,,,,,,,
c50683,s7,Could have gotten room at larger Venetian,,,,,,,,
c50683,s8,"Rooms clean, ok size",,,,,,,,
c50683,s9,but no wifi,,,,,,,,
c50683,s10,A bit strange for new 5 star hotel,,,,,,,,
c50683,s11,"Unless prices come down, we will stay at other places in cotai next time",,,,,,,,
c50684,s1,First time to Macao so wasn't really sure what to expect,,,,,,,,
c50684,s2,Chose the Sheraton as the deals they were offering at the time made them around 30% cheaper than any of the other hotels,,,,,,,,
c50684,s3,"Situated on the Cotai side, it's still only a 15 minute ride by taxi over to where the Wynn, etc are all located, but being on the Cotai side it's 5 min from Macau Airport and the Tapai Ferry terminals as well as Caesars Golf Club",,,,,,,,
c50684,s4,It's also connected by a walk bridge over to the Venetian,,,,,,,,
c50684,s5,"Living in Singapore, so used to Marina Bay Sands and also having done Vegas a few times, the Sheraton is like a mini cut down version of any of the big hotels on the Vegas strip",,,,,,,,
c50684,s6,"First things first, it's not overly busy so check in and check out is nice and easy and you avoid the usual 'Vegas-esque' queues",,,,,,,,
c50684,s7,_,,,,,,,,
c50685,s1,Visited the premises on a business trip,,,,,,,,
c50685,s2,My hosts booked me into this one since it was the closest to the Venetian which was our daily meeting point,,,,,,,,
c50685,s3,Walked into the room where to my horror the wall that separates the bed from the bathroom was covered in spit,,,,,,,,
c50685,s4,The rest of the room was quite dirty but the bathroom looked fresh,,,,,,,,
c50685,s5,I immediately informed them and they came to clean it,,,,,,,,
c50685,s6,For my 4 day stay they changed the towels but never really cleaned again,,,,,,,,
c50685,s7,NO WIFI in rooms and even if you want to pay its only available on LAN,,,,,,,,
c50685,s8,Ridiculous if your on business just with a smartphone,,,,,,,,
c50685,s9,The lobby offers free wifi but with the casino attracting hundreds of people at all times you have no internet and your phone bill will kill you,,,,,,,,
c50685,s10,Breakfast seems to be an issue for everyone on business as_,,,,,,,,
c50686,s1,It was my 1st visit of Macau and therefore I have choosen a well known hotel,,,,,,,,
c50686,s2,I am used to stay in 5 star Kempinski hotels and my expectation was to find something similar,,,,,,,,
c50686,s3,I make every morning some exercises and yoga and doing that I have to lay down at the floor,,,,,,,,
c50686,s4,Being in that position I looked around and saw the chair in front of the desk,,,,,,,,
c50686,s5,And I saw the dust from the last weeks or even months! The chair was so dirty that I got a very bad impression about the cleanliness of this hotel,,,,,,,,
c50686,s6,Talking to my chinese friends they told me that this is just normal in China but for a me used to the eurpean standard this is not acceptable,,,,,,,,
c50686,s7,My frustration was completed when they denied to write on my bill that breakfast was not included,,,,,,,,
c50686,s8,"""Our software does not allow any change and for the_",,,,,,,,
c50687,s1,"I have to be honest, I was not that impressed with the Sheraton Macau",,,,,,,,
c50687,s2,Service was a bit slow,,,,,,,,
c50687,s3,"I requested a non smoking room, and the room REAKED of Cigar smoke",,,,,,,,
c50687,s4,I called to complain from the lobby because even the phone was unhooked in the room,,,,,,,,
c50687,s5,So they sent someone up 20 minutes later who also agreed that the rooms smelled like smoke,,,,,,,,
c50687,s6,It was really nasty that they even put anyone in that room,,,,,,,,
c50687,s7,"Other than that, the rooms are typical Sheraton rooms, dont expect fast room service, the hotel is so large that it takes them forever just to bring ice",,,,,,,,
c50687,s8,Location is pretty good since its right across the Venetian which I stayed at the month prior,,,,,,,,
c50687,s9,"I think if you can spend the money, go for the venetian, their smallest room is 75 sqm",,,,,,,,
c50687,s10,"Buffet was not bad, but cheap",,,,,,,,
c50687,s11,you get what_,,,,,,,,
c50688,s1,The Sheraton itself is a largely anonymous hotel that shares a casino and shopping mall with the adjoining Conrad and Holiday Inn on the newly developed Cotai Strip,,,,,,,,
c50688,s2,supposedly the Macao Vegas,,,,,,,,
c50688,s3,"The problem is, it has the buildings but zero atmosphere",,,,,,,,
c50688,s4,"something further exaggerated by the now ubiquitous designer shopping mall (I counted 4 Omega shops, 2 Dunhill stores and 4 IWCshops in 3 adjacent hotel / casino/ malls)",,,,,,,,
c50688,s5,As you can gather this review is as much coloured by the Macao strip as anything else,,,,,,,,
c50688,s6,"Where as Vegas has a unique character to it, Macao is soulless",,,,,,,,
c50688,s7,The casino floors have no vibe and are often half empty,,,,,,,,
c50688,s8,"Clearly the move towards a smoking ban hasn't reached Macao yet and despite requesting and, after some negotiating, getting a non-smoking room, the_",,,,,,,,
c50689,s1,This was my first and probably the last time staying at the new Sheraton,,,,,,,,
c50689,s2,I travelled with my friend for a girls weekend away and booked the Club Floor deal so we could get some peace and quiet,,,,,,,,
c50689,s3,"Sadly, this did not happen for us",,,,,,,,
c50689,s4,We were escorted to the Sky Tower Club Lounge,,,,,,,,
c50689,s5,it was quiet a walk from the shuttle bus lobby,,,,,,,,
c50689,s6,It is huge and looks like a restaurant bar more than a business lounge,,,,,,,,
c50689,s7,One end is the dining area for bfast and cocktails and the other is a large relaxing space,,,,,,,,
c50689,s8,In the middle is a smaller bar area where afternoon tea is served,,,,,,,,
c50689,s9,We got checked in quickly by a friendly staff and our room was ready,,,,,,,,
c50689,s10,"Our room was on a high floor but nothing special, it was just their standard room type",,,,,,,,
c50689,s11,It was small compared to the Venetian and we were rather disappointed_,,,,,,,,
c50690,s1,The shuttle bus from Macau Ferry Terminal dropped me off at the east wing instead of the main lobby of Sheraton,,,,,,,,
c50690,s2,"When I walked in, I saw the big sign of SPG from the left hand side of general check-in counter",,,,,,,,
c50690,s3,"As there were a lot of non-SPG members, I asked the staff if there was any available staff dedicated to SPG customers",,,,,,,,
c50690,s4,The staff told me that I would have to walk all the way to the main lobby,,,,,,,,
c50690,s5,"When I walked towards to the main lobby, I found another SPG counter",,,,,,,,
c50690,s6,Again there were no staff,,,,,,,,
c50690,s7,I asked another hotel staff for help and he told me that the counter was closed as it was lunch time,,,,,,,,
c50690,s8,But I had never seen any staff at that SPG counter during my stay,,,,,,,,
c50690,s9,The same thing happened to another SPG counter near to the Earth Tower,,,,,,,,
c50690,s10,The only available SPG counter was in the_,,,,,,,,
c50691,s1,"I am a Starwood fan but this was clearly ""City of dreams/Sands"" The staff were great but the exec club was so far below mainland China or Starwood managed it was laughable!  It was Super 8 or 168 in the Club level",,,,,,,,
c50691,s2,Why so cheap?,,,,,,,,
c50692,s1,We spent one night in the executive floor with club lounge facilities,,,,,,,,
c50692,s2,The hotel room was not too big and the decoration was just average,,,,,,,,
c50692,s3,The white paint on the washroom door fell off and made the room looked dated even though it should be quite a new hotel,,,,,,,,
c50692,s4,We went to the lounge that had very dim light and it looked like a bar rather than a business lounge!   Both the cocktails and breakfast offered large varieties of food but the environment in the lounge was noisy and looked like a buffet restaurant!  The swimming pool was not big and was crowded with people!,,,,,,,,
c50693,s1,I waited a few weeks to write this review because I wanted to see if my disappointment with this hotel decreased,,,,,,,,
c50693,s2,"However, after all this time, I am still regretting my decision to stay at the Sheraton Macau",,,,,,,,
c50693,s3,We chose this hotel over the Holiday Inn because as SPG members we have always been impressed with the high quality service from the Sheraton brand,,,,,,,,
c50693,s4,"However, if I ever go back to Macau then I would definitely choose the Galaxy or the Holiday Inn over the Sheraton",,,,,,,,
c50693,s5,"After prepaying our room in advance, we were informed by our airline that our flight had been cancelled so we would need to fly home a day earlier",,,,,,,,
c50693,s6,After many painful discussions with the Sheraton they were unwilling to refund our additional night,,,,,,,,
c50693,s7,We weren__ happy but ok with this especially since we_,,,,,,,,
c50694,s1,This is an interesting property for a variety of the reasons,,,,,,,,
c50694,s2,"It's the biggest Sheraton in the world, with literally thousands of rooms on the sprawling property, and they're not small",,,,,,,,
c50694,s3,"As a Platinum SPG member, I was upgraded from my standard room to a Deluxe Suite that approached 1000 feet, with a media room, full living room, and enormous bathroom",,,,,,,,
c50694,s4,"Suite upgrades, from what I can tell, are far from uncommon, and the materials in these rooms are literally shiny and new",,,,,,,,
c50694,s5,Everything is glossy and modern,,,,,,,,
c50694,s6,These are some of the best rooms you'll see within the Sheraton system,,,,,,,,
c50694,s7,"The club lounge is enormous and almost comically overstaffed; every time I visited the lounge, I was greeted by no fewer than five employees",,,,,,,,
c50694,s8,"The lows, though, make it clear how this is still a young_",,,,,,,,
c50695,s1,We are a young couple who came to macau for a relaxing weekend away,,,,,,,,
c50695,s2,We decided to pay more for the Club Floor as thought it would be nice to have some extra things included during our stay,,,,,,,,
c50695,s3,We have enjpyed the club floor at pther hotels during our travels but we both felt that it was not worth the extra money at the Sheraton,,,,,,,,
c50695,s4,Both times we went to the club lounge we had to queue up for tables and the staff were rushing around trying to seat people,,,,,,,,
c50695,s5,"Tables were cluttered with dishes and they were under staffed, lining up beside the toilets was not pleasant",,,,,,,,
c50695,s6,"We did not enjoy the club lounge, it is dark and quite far away from the club floor rooms",,,,,,,,
c50695,s7,"There are no other benefits staying in a club room, you get breakfast included and the afternoon tea in the lounge",,,,,,,,
c50695,s8,There is no_,,,,,,,,
c50696,s1,"To those of you that arrive Macau by ferry, just want to let you know that there is a free shuttle provided from the hotel  at the Macau Ferry Terminal",,,,,,,,
c50696,s2,"Honestly, you won't see the sign like any other shuttle to other famous hotels, follow the sign for shuttle and just walk to the other side and you will see that Green Color bus, that's for Sheraton",,,,,,,,
c50696,s3,"The hotel is actually at Cotai Strip, which you can find Venetian & Hard Rock hotel or Dream City is just near by and is also next to Holiday Inn Hotel, so everything seems just like walking distance which is nice",,,,,,,,
c50696,s4,"Check in: I think her name is Karen and she is such a sweetheart, she is so patiently assist us for the registration",,,,,,,,
c50696,s5,"Sheraton must be lucky to have her, seriously, she is one of best customer service I received",,,,,,,,
c50696,s6,(But_,,,,,,,,
c50697,s1,First time stay in this new Sheraton for a friday night after work,,,,,,,,
c50697,s2,"The room is nice, staff is helpful, everything just like my previous experience in Sheraton hotels",,,,,,,,
c50697,s3,"Well, however when I check out in the next morning,  I was told I have had breakfast in earlier time, which I didn't",,,,,,,,
c50697,s4,"And I was told to wait so that they can check what happened, that's still fine for me",,,,,,,,
c50697,s5,"Later on another staff come to us with the receipt of the breakfast, telling me that he/she could quote my room number and my full name to consume the breakfast",,,,,,,,
c50697,s6,"Then she demand my friend and I to sign on a blank paper so that she can ""VERIFY"" the signature on the receipt",,,,,,,,
c50697,s7,We know we shouldn't but we did sign as we're in a hurry,,,,,,,,
c50697,s8,"Finally she told me that the breakfast charge is ""WAIVED"" for me, I questioned_",,,,,,,,
c50698,s1,Did not expect this is a style of new furbished Sheraton,,,,,,,,
c50698,s2,I expect more to the brand of Sheraon,,,,,,,,
c50698,s3,"In terms of Location, it was great as connected to other hotels and casino",,,,,,,,
c50698,s4,"however, too packed in the lobby and seems like a four-star hotel for guestroom corridor",,,,,,,,
c50698,s5,"Room size was large, offer double-double rooms which I do expect",,,,,,,,
c50698,s6,Bathroom was not clean enough,,,,,,,,
c50698,s7,would rather choose to stay Conrad for next stay,,,,,,,,
c50699,s1,I have been stayed there 2 months ago,,,,,,,,
c50699,s2,the hotel is average,,,,,,,,
c50699,s3,the facilities seems not new even they just opening not longtime,,,,,,,,
c50699,s4,But it is very rediculous that I havent get my accommodation deposit back yet since 2 month,,,,,,,,
c50699,s5,they keep telling me just 5days,,,,,,,,
c50699,s6,5days,,,,,,,,
c50699,s7,and that is not their fault for this problem,,,,,,,,
c50699,s8,i have to say the service is suck!!! how they treat their guest?  or they dont do breifing for work?,,,,,,,,
c50700,s1,"After having read all of the very positive reviews about the Sheraton Macau, I was really looking forward to our stay",,,,,,,,
c50700,s2,"However, I return home rather disasppointed by the who experience",,,,,,,,
c50700,s3,The hotel is new and as such it looks great,,,,,,,,
c50700,s4,"I have no complaints about the ""hardware"" (ok, I have one, which I will mention below)",,,,,,,,
c50700,s5,"The hotel rooms are adequately sized, if not very large",,,,,,,,
c50700,s6,The facilities are all very good,,,,,,,,
c50700,s7,The bed is extremely comortable and I slept very well both nights we were there,,,,,,,,
c50700,s8,The bathroom was large and had all of the essential facilties,,,,,,,,
c50700,s9,"The toilet itself was slow to fill after use and a little noisy, but no big deal",,,,,,,,
c50700,s10,The only issue I have with the room is the soundproofing to the corridor,,,,,,,,
c50700,s11,The door is very thin and basically you can hear everything that goes on in_,,,,,,,,
c50701,s1,Friends arranged an Easter weekend in Macau for a celebration and we stayed at the Sheraton,,,,,,,,
c50701,s2,It was everyone's first time,,,,,,,,
c50701,s3,Caught the free shuttle at the airport for the hotel which was a short 10-min ride away,,,,,,,,
c50701,s4,We did expect a busy crowd for the holiday weekend but were pleasantly surprised to find the check-in desk queue fairly short,,,,,,,,
c50701,s5,We got rooms on the 13th floor and on the side facing the pool which looked to be on the 10th level or so,,,,,,,,
c50701,s6,Beware though of rooms 1333 upwards as the view is not directly of the pool but of the power generators etc on the roof top next to the pool,,,,,,,,
c50701,s7,Quite unslightly but some may not mind if they don't spend a lot of time in the room and look out the window,,,,,,,,
c50701,s8,"The Deluxe room is pretty standard in terms of size, facilities etc",,,,,,,,
c50701,s9,"Personally, I'd_",,,,,,,,
c50702,s1,Sheraton sent me a couple of emails before my arrival to ensure they could entertain my requests - very hospitable,,,,,,,,
c50702,s2,"Got my Hi floor, non-smoking room in a quiet section as requested",,,,,,,,
c50702,s3,"However, there is not much view as the opposite is either the Holiday Inn or Conrad and in the middle is a vast area with Air-Cons and facilities",,,,,,,,
c50702,s4,I can see that the swimming pool is comparatively small and is not meant to accommodate over 100 Guests,,,,,,,,
c50702,s5,You need to always have the outer laced curtain closed to preserve Privacy as the exterior window is not the reflective type,,,,,,,,
c50702,s6,The room was slightly smaller than the one at Galaxy and the ceiling was comparatively low,,,,,,,,
c50702,s7,Actually you will feel the low ceiling once you exit the lift,,,,,,,,
c50702,s8,I believe if you are 6 ft high you might have to lower your head a_,,,,,,,,
c50703,s1,My partner and I went to Macau for a couple of nights for Christmas,,,,,,,,
c50703,s2,"We had a good time, but the Sheraton is so big that it gives a strange impression of not being in a regular hotel",,,,,,,,
c50703,s3,The executive lounge is bigger than most hotels breakfast room but you still have to wait in line to get a breakfast table and it feels everything but 'exclusive',,,,,,,,
c50703,s4,We got upgraded to a great suite,,,,,,,,
c50703,s5,It was very comfortable but the decor was really tacky,,,,,,,,
c50703,s6,"Service was not bad, especially when you think of the sheer number of guests that they must have",,,,,,,,
c50703,s7,"The staff member at the club lounge who checked us in kept on insisting that we get two beds, which was not very sensitive to diversity! A chain like the Sheraton should train its staff better to be more sensitive to travelers needs as this made us_",,,,,,,,
c50704,s1,The hotel is new,,,,,,,,
c50704,s2,However the service is so poor,,,,,,,,
c50704,s3,"There are many staff here, but nobody can better serve you",,,,,,,,
c50704,s4,Chech in need to wait for a long time,,,,,,,,
c50704,s5,"The room is not really clean, so much dirt in the furniture",,,,,,,,
c50704,s6,The check out time also takes so long,,,,,,,,
c50704,s7,The hotel really need to train the staff to be polite,,,,,,,,
c50705,s1,"don't get me wrong, this is a beautiful looking hotel",,,,,,,,
c50705,s2,The buffet is to die for,,,,,,,,
c50705,s3,"I've stayed at pretty awful hotels in the past but the service was sooo good that they made the hotel ""look"" good",,,,,,,,
c50705,s4,"I'm afraid that I've had better service EVERYWHERE else in macau, and I travel here often",,,,,,,,
c50705,s5,1 hour to check in,,,,,,,,
c50705,s6,long lines,,,,,,,,
c50705,s7,Poorly trained staff,,,,,,,,
c50705,s8,"So the ""shine"" on this new hotel is quite dull",,,,,,,,
c50705,s9,My advice: for the money try any other hotel in Macau,,,,,,,,
c50705,s10,4 stars for hotel but 1 star for service,,,,,,,,
c50705,s11,Express checked out as the line was so long I wasn't going to wait another hour,,,,,,,,
c50705,s12,"Then, thankyou so much for the extra charges added on my card that I did not authorise",,,,,,,,
c50705,s13,bad,,,,,,,,
c50706,s1,"bland feeling,staff not particularly warm nor readily conversant in english",,,,,,,,
c50706,s2,"new complex is ok i guess fren summed it up nicely, 'I think they are a 4 and a half star establishment?' For comparable rates, I'd probably go to other competitors  Cons  Bathtub too small even for asians",,,,,,,,
c50706,s3,"Towels though brand new are not luxuriant, has that spongy material feel",,,,,,,,
c50706,s4,"Toiletries again, look like something to be found in an SJM establishment not an international chain For a big complex they need to have been directions, especially for breakfast dining  Cordless phone base station keeps flashing green to signal that its on, very distracting when all the lights are off and you're trying to sleep  Pros One out of 3 pool areas was open and it was quite nice, though couldn't really do much given_",,,,,,,,
c50707,s1,"I have high standards of Starwood - Sheraton hotels and I travel alot and stay in Sheraton every single time! English is an International language! What makes me really upset is when I speak in English, agents reply in Cantonese or mandarin? Agents did not make my trip any easier when I enquire about site seeing and restaurants",,,,,,,,
c50707,s2,Poor product knowledge,,,,,,,,
c50707,s3,Most importantly is manager on duty kept talking to agents in mandarin in front of me upon check out,,,,,,,,
c50707,s4,"I might not know how to speak Cantonese or mandarin, but I can understand",,,,,,,,
c50707,s5,"I'm sure the manager on duty and agent said I'm ""troublesome guest"" in mandarin! What a 5 star hotel! I will not recommend Sheraton macao",,,,,,,,
c50707,s6,Below my expectation! More like low class motel to me! Such a disappointment on Sheraton macao!,,,,,,,,
c50708,s1,Me and my family (3 kids) stay twice in this hotel,,,,,,,,
c50708,s2,The first visit was back in October 2012 when the hotel just opened,,,,,,,,
c50708,s3,"It was a nice place, promotions, attentiveness of the staff made its part so that we even decided to extend our trip for one more night",,,,,,,,
c50708,s4,Overall it was a pleasant expirience so we have decided to repeat this during Chineese NY,,,,,,,,
c50708,s5,To our delight hotel offered weekend escape package which included breakfast and late check out option (upto 5 pm),,,,,,,,
c50708,s6,As we are traveling with small kids late check out was our target as it allow to plan naps/breaks/lunches pretty well,,,,,,,,
c50708,s7,We also bought afternoon return tickets back to Hong Kong in advance as NY days promised to be busy,,,,,,,,
c50708,s8,Despite the crowd check in was passed more or less smoothly,,,,,,,,
c50708,s9,I have ordered an extra bed for our older_,,,,,,,,
c50709,s1,"It's a rare occasion that I feel compelled to write a negative review for a hotel, but as it just so happens, the Sheraton Macau has earned it",,,,,,,,
c50709,s2,"I stayed in the Sheraton Macau back in December for three nights for a work conference, also hosted at the hotel",,,,,,,,
c50709,s3,"As a seasoned Starwood guest (I've been a Platinum member since 2009), I was happy to learn that I'd be staying at the Sheraton rather a different property, as I have, up to this point, had very good experiences with Starwood properties",,,,,,,,
c50709,s4,"While the accommodation and amenities was on-par with other Sheraton hotels around the world, and the room equally as comfortable, the customer service was by comparison, abysmal",,,,,,,,
c50709,s5,"Upon check-in, I was quickly shuffled through the maze of ropes to the front desk",,,,,,,,
c50709,s6,"I received my room key,_",,,,,,,,
c50710,s1,"I arrived Macau around midnight, hotel shuttle bus was nice and conveniece to get us to hotel, it came to surprise when arrived at hotel with absolutely no belt",,,,,,,,
c50710,s2,"At check in counter very minimum service, the room key was just handed in and I had to carried all 4 luggages up to the room by myself without any help at all",,,,,,,,
c50710,s3,"What a lack service! Always enjoy starwood hotel, but this one is believed to be such below standard!",,,,,,,,
c50711,s1,We arrived late at night in January and we stayed in this hotel for 3 days,,,,,,,,
c50711,s2,"At first, we were happy with the accommodation but on the second night, I had an allergy due to dust mites! Good thing they provided a doctor, and she gave me a lot of medicines to take",,,,,,,,
c50711,s3,The hotel transferred us to a suite that day and brought us fruits as a compensation to my situation,,,,,,,,
c50711,s4,My parents who stayed in another room experienced bed bugs as well,,,,,,,,
c50711,s5,"I've been traveling a lot around Asia, and this is the first time that I got an allergy------ from a 5 star hotel in Macau!  Stay here at your own risk!",,,,,,,,
c50712,s1,This hotel is big very big,,,,,,,,
c50712,s2,Was drawn here by the sheer size of the place but disappointed by the mob mentality of the place,,,,,,,,
c50712,s3,Check in is disorganized chaos if you can even reach the check in area,,,,,,,,
c50712,s4,Finally found someone who understood that we are Platinum members and sent us on a small marathon to the club lounge check in,,,,,,,,
c50712,s5,Finally arrived at the room after walking forever,,,,,,,,
c50712,s6,The room is big but poorly fitted out,,,,,,,,
c50712,s7,The bathroom door doesn't lock and there is no bubble bath for the huge bath,,,,,,,,
c50712,s8,After venturing out please remember your room key as security is tighter than Fort Knox,,,,,,,,
c50712,s9,The club lounge is impersonal beyond belief and the hungry horde that arrives for breakfast simply ruins the ambience of the lounge,,,,,,,,
c50712,s10,Don't ask for any assistance as you won't get any just move with the mass_,,,,,,,,
c50713,s1,"It is a very big hotel with 2 towers, named as sky tower and earth tower",,,,,,,,
c50713,s2,The hotel shuttle bus took us from ferry terminal to hotel but we did not know which tower it stopped,,,,,,,,
c50713,s3,"Right behind where the bus stopped, we found the check-in counter and after our 2 days stay, I think there were at least 3 check-in areas",,,,,,,,
c50713,s4,"The check-in staff was very nice, his mother tongue is mandarin but he tried very best to communicate with us in English",,,,,,,,
c50713,s5,"Check-in was also quick and efficient, but we needed to walk a long way to our room which was at the Sky tower",,,,,,,,
c50713,s6,"When we arrived the Sky Tower just opposite the Chow Tai Fook jewelry shop (with a prominent sign in front), we found the doors closed but not locked",,,,,,,,
c50713,s7,We then opened the doors and found the lifts lobby inside,,,,,,,,
c50713,s8,"Suddenly, a security guard_",,,,,,,,
c50714,s1,Following last comment I also stayed in hotel during CNY and I am a SPG member myself,,,,,,,,
c50714,s2,I booked 2 club rooms,,,,,,,,
c50714,s3,"The check-in procedures at Club Lounge were smooth, and staff were friendly explaining the benfits",,,,,,,,
c50714,s4,"The room itself is new, spacious and clean",,,,,,,,
c50714,s5,The decor is rather simple,,,,,,,,
c50714,s6,"There are 3 meal options belonging to hotel, but don't bother to go there, because there are loads of restaurants in the adherant shopping malls",,,,,,,,
c50714,s7,Now come to the negative experience,,,,,,,,
c50714,s8,"First, I don't like the breakfast set-up, due to high occupancy it was set in a ballroom, which made me feel no privacy at all",,,,,,,,
c50714,s9,"I was warned the breakfast time might be busy, so I came at 7am",,,,,,,,
c50714,s10,"The food choice was quite limited, and not up to 5 star standard",,,,,,,,
c50714,s11,"Second, as one of the club floor benefits, welcome fruit and_",,,,,,,,
c50715,s1,"Check in service unorganized and could not find reservation for our small group, rooms small but clean",,,,,,,,
c50715,s2,Breakfast very good quality and variety,,,,,,,,
c50715,s3,much better than Venetian,,,,,,,,
c50715,s4,Friendly service especially guy that cooks eggs,,,,,,,,
c50716,s1,My family and i spent our New year holiday at this hotel,,,,,,,,
c50716,s2,I already read some of the reviews of this hotel so more or less i had an inkling of what to expect,,,,,,,,
c50716,s3,"Indeed, it was kind of confusing upon arrival at the hotel",,,,,,,,
c50716,s4,We didnt know which reception area we are supposed to check in,,,,,,,,
c50716,s5,"There were a lot of guests in the lobby and at the same time, hotel staff guiding first time guests",,,,,,,,
c50716,s6,It was not a breeze during check in time,,,,,,,,
c50716,s7,And it was a relief when we were done with the check in,,,,,,,,
c50716,s8,there was no waiting area for family's who wait to be checked in,,,,,,,,
c50716,s9,So we just stood in one corner while we wait for one member of the family to check us all in,,,,,,,,
c50716,s10,"And when we were about to go to our rooms, we got lost coz the structure of the hotel was a bit confusing",,,,,,,,
c50716,s11,i cannot even begin to describe it,,,,,,,,
c50716,s12,_,,,,,,,,
c50717,s1,It was our wedding anniversary and we came over to Sheraton Macao for a short stay,,,,,,,,
c50717,s2,"The hotel is under a soft opening, not all the shops and facilities are fully opened",,,,,,,,
c50717,s3,"It was the first time we stay at the Sheraton, but you might want to know that we stayed at the other hotel at the same complex (Cotai Central)",,,,,,,,
c50717,s4,"I can confidently tell you that all three hotel buildings were built by the same developer with very similar layout, perhaps a slightly different design and interior color scheme, so my tip is, check all three of them (Sheraton, Holiday Inn, and Conrad) and see which one gives you the best deal",,,,,,,,
c50717,s5,"I was greeted by enthusiatic and cheerful staff, smartly recognized my Gold member status and re-direct me to the proper counter for a friendly and efficient check in",,,,,,,,
c50717,s6,_,,,,,,,,
c50718,s1,We spent two nights at this hotel,,,,,,,,
c50718,s2,"Prior to our arrival, we received an e-mail from a guest services agent asking us if they could be of any assistance",,,,,,,,
c50718,s3,This really impressed us and we were expecting great things from the property,,,,,,,,
c50718,s4,We arrived late at the ferry terminal and took the free coach to the hotel,,,,,,,,
c50718,s5,"We were the only guests at check-in, yet it took an absolute age to be assigned our room",,,,,,,,
c50718,s6,The staff was poorly trained and did not understand how SPG Cash and Points works,,,,,,,,
c50718,s7,It must have taken at least 25 minutes to give us our room keys,,,,,,,,
c50718,s8,Throughout the entire experience nobody explained to us what was happening and given that I don't speak Chinese was completely unsure what was happening,,,,,,,,
c50718,s9,Then came the nightmare with the lifts,,,,,,,,
c50718,s10,They simply do not have enough lifts to move the_,,,,,,,,
c50719,s1,We booked 2 rooms to stay over the recent weekend before NYE,,,,,,,,
c50719,s2,On arrival at the ferry we looked out for the free shuttle service to the hotel,,,,,,,,
c50719,s3,Very convenient as it is only 10 mins from the hotel,,,,,,,,
c50719,s4,"Likewise on return , very convenient to board the shuttle bus back to Cotai ferry terminal",,,,,,,,
c50719,s5,This hotel is massive!!!! like 4000 rooms,,,,,,,,
c50719,s6,Check in was fast and very pleasant,,,,,,,,
c50719,s7,We got upgraded to a deluxe and executive suite,,,,,,,,
c50719,s8,VERY nice surprise,,,,,,,,
c50719,s9,The suites and furnishing were very tastefully decorated,,,,,,,,
c50719,s10,"The deluxe suite was massive, would be a size of a 3 bedroom apartment in Sydney It had a separate powder room on entry",,,,,,,,
c50719,s11,The living room and dining area was very spacious,,,,,,,,
c50719,s12,"A large flat screen TV was in living room, another TV room with fold out sofa and main bedroom with king size bed and_",,,,,,,,
c50720,s1,"We enjoyed a well appointed Executive Suite - great space, comfy bed, fantastic view",,,,,,,,
c50720,s2,"For such a large hotel, the staff are well briefed on the hotels amenities + extremely polite & helpful",,,,,,,,
c50720,s3,These are the highlights - the Club experience is the low point of the Sheraton,,,,,,,,
c50720,s4,Having traveled extensively  and experienced many club floors the Sheraton needs to re-think how this is achieved in a 4000 room hotel,,,,,,,,
c50720,s5,"Space is odd - feels like a cafeteria, little natural light & uncomfortable furnishings - due to over crowding a ball room was pressed into service - food sub-par - staff overwhelmed with the hordes of guests",,,,,,,,
c50720,s6,I have never had to queue behind 150+ people to get entry into a lounge - requested breakfast vouchers for the main restaurant Feast on both days - food is better here -_,,,,,,,,
c50721,s1,We booked an Executive Suite with Club Floor privileges,,,,,,,,
c50721,s2,"The suite was very nice and well appointed, but that is where our happiness ended",,,,,,,,
c50721,s3,"This hotel has 4,000 rooms so we thought a Club Floor would provide a more personal service and less crowds - we were soooo wrong",,,,,,,,
c50721,s4,The whole Sheraton Macao club experience was a disappointment,,,,,,,,
c50721,s5,"The club lounge looks like a converted ball room, the food and  beverage service feels like a slightly upscale cafeteria",,,,,,,,
c50721,s6,"It was noisy not enough chairs, no service, and uncontrolled children running  around the lounge",,,,,,,,
c50721,s7,"We couldn't even get into the lounge for breakfast, day 1 as it had a queue of 200 people (I am not exaggerating I counted them) waiting to be seated for breakfast",,,,,,,,
c50721,s8,!   Day 2 was the same so we queued in the shorter queue in_,,,,,,,,
c50722,s1,When we booked the family suite we saw pictures on tripadvisor that included two bedrooms and a living room,,,,,,,,
c50722,s2,"When we checked in, alas it only contained two bedrooms with adjoining door",,,,,,,,
c50722,s3,The check ins were very slow,,,,,,,,
c50722,s4,"Having say that, Nash Wong the receptionist had been very helpful trying to meet our expectations",,,,,,,,
c50722,s5,"Overall the front line needs to improve on its service, speed and communication",,,,,,,,
c50723,s1,The experience was memorable but in the negative sense,,,,,,,,
c50723,s2,We were there for on Sunday (Dec 16) for 1 night stay with my in-laws & 2 sisters in laws & spouses,,,,,,,,
c50723,s3,We were told at the check in at the regular 2pm check in time  that out rooms will not be ready until 4pm,,,,,,,,
c50723,s4,That was a bit of shock but we let it go so went  out for snack & sight seeing,,,,,,,,
c50723,s5,"Once we got out rooms, we went to check it out",,,,,,,,
c50723,s6,My in laws & sitters in law's rooms got to their respective rooms fine,,,,,,,,
c50723,s7,"For us, it was quite surprise when we found our room got luggage and underwear's hanging in the bathroom",,,,,,,,
c50723,s8,So we called the front desk & they dispatched a customer service manager up to see us while we waited in our in law's room,,,,,,,,
c50723,s9,The Customer service manager asked us to check the room with her & the first word she said was_,,,,,,,,
c50724,s1,Staff is lack of experience; I was offered free local call & leave them the coupon when checking-in,,,,,,,,
c50724,s2,"However, I still have to clear those questions when I check-out",,,,,,,,
c50724,s3,"Most staff cannot speak English or Cantonese, difficult to communicate",,,,,,,,
c50724,s4,"When I was back to HK, I found out I was being ignored by the hotel",,,,,,,,
c50724,s5,"I check-in in the 4th floor (notify by email) for being SPG member & booked a Suite Room, I do not have Relationship staff/ manager to coach me to the Suite, I had to bring along all my entire luggage to the room which I was lost during my findings of the Suite",,,,,,,,
c50724,s6,I bit confuse & anger,,,,,,,,
c50724,s7,"Also, I wasn__ told about the Club stuff, I need to ask them every questions like breakfast arrangement, of course they don__ even mentioned evening cocktail which I have totally missed during_",,,,,,,,
c50725,s1,Stayed in the twin bed room for a nite just before the christmas,,,,,,,,
c50725,s2,"Front line staff serving at the SPG counter are well trained, all my requests are being taken care of",,,,,,,,
c50725,s3,Rooms are large comparing with the New Holiday Inn at the next block,,,,,,,,
c50725,s4,"However, only two tiny kids' dipping outdoor pools are available for guests, (a lot facilities are still not yet finish), while the ""heated"" water are too weak for winter's time;  construction noises could be heard in most of the areas includling your own guest room",,,,,,,,
c50725,s5,"Bene the Italian restuarant serves very good dishes in bargin price, and its unexpected quiet during lunch hours",,,,,,,,
c50726,s1,"We have booked (and paid through a single agency) for 3 rooms, 2 of which are for 2 nights and one is for one night",,,,,,,,
c50726,s2,Here is our bad experience with the counter staff,,,,,,,,
c50726,s3,"Our check in took at least 10 to 15 minutes, the hotel staff was busy with the computer keyboard all the time until he finally figured out all the room numbers",,,,,,,,
c50726,s4,"Normally, we expect this to take 5 minutes or less",,,,,,,,
c50726,s5,"The hotel staff has also forgotten to give us the breakfast tickets which should be included in the package, fortunately we remembered to ask for that before leaving the counter",,,,,,,,
c50726,s6,"However, later that day we discovered the key jackets for all 3 rooms wrote we need to check out the next morning",,,,,,,,
c50726,s7,"When we returned to the counter for clarification, another hotel staff said such mistake may be because we_",,,,,,,,
c50727,s1,"Everything I am going to share below is truly based on my feedback from the customer's perspective for a family with a child and I see that this hotel is very nicely built with malls connected but as a new hotel, there are a lot of areas for improvement",,,,,,,,
c50727,s2,I stayed the weekend before X'mas and my wife and I and my 2,,,,,,,,
c50727,s3,5 year old came with a ferry from HK,,,,,,,,
c50727,s4,I am a SPG gold member,,,,,,,,
c50727,s5,"When we arrived at the ferry, we didn't see sign where the Sheraton shuttle was but no big deal and we found it at the end",,,,,,,,
c50727,s6,I had a luggage and a stroller while my wife was holding the kid,,,,,,,,
c50727,s7,There was no help offered by the staff to help with the luggage,,,,,,,,
c50727,s8,ok,,,,,,,,
c50727,s9,fine as I thought they might not be direct hotel staff,,,,,,,,
c50727,s10,"When we arrived at the hotel, once again, I had to take out the luggage and stroller by_",,,,,,,,
c50728,s1,"Sheraton Macau was recently opened for business, rooms were no doubt clean",,,,,,,,
c50728,s2,The rooms were comfy with 2 double beds,,,,,,,,
c50728,s3,"However, I find the location of the hotel a little too far from all other activities and attractions",,,,,,,,
c50728,s4,"Furthermore, there is no free wifi in the room, you have to pay for it",,,,,,,,
c50728,s5,"We were told their free shuttle service to Macau island starts about 11am, which is too late by my standard, would be better if it can be slightly early",,,,,,,,
c50728,s6,"Obviously from the above, their main aim is to try and make you stay in the casino and gamble the whole day",,,,,,,,
c50728,s7,"If gaming is not your aim, I suggest you get another hotel",,,,,,,,
c50728,s8,"I also found their pricing a little steep, at the price we paid, we probably could have gotten a better deal nearby",,,,,,,,
c50729,s1,I booked 2 rooms at this hotel for me and my colleagues,,,,,,,,
c50729,s2,However I came across a few questions and would like a respond from the actual hotel itself rather than the central res (1800 number) or Agoda (which is where I booked through),,,,,,,,
c50729,s3,My first attempt was to call the hotel's number +853 2880 2000,,,,,,,,
c50729,s4,"The phone keeps ringing and ringing, not even the promo message or what-so-ever",,,,,,,,
c50729,s5,"Totally not within the industry standard of ""answer within 3 rings""",,,,,,,,
c50729,s6,My second attempt was to call the central reservation 1800 073 535,,,,,,,,
c50729,s7,"I was assisted by a young lady, I asked her why is it impossible to get in contact with the hotel directly, which the lady laughs and said ""maybe they were too busy""",,,,,,,,
c50729,s8,"I asked whether free wifi comes with my booking, she told me Wifi is free only for certain room types,_",,,,,,,,
c50730,s1,"Just stayed at sheraton for 4 nights - would not have commented at all about my negative impression - until finding out that I have been double charged for the stay (pre- paid, then charged the entire amount again in error after departure without my permission or signature or even invoice)",,,,,,,,
c50730,s2,A few specific gripes: The service was mediocre - many staff did not speak English (including the waiter whom brought room service - but did not understand instructions when I was half dressed after a shower and needing some privacy,,,,,,,,
c50730,s3,)  Wifi not included in room fee - had to be bought hourly/daily,,,,,,,,
c50730,s4,Even budget cafes have wifi - why can't this so called luxury hotel,,,,,,,,
c50730,s5,Full of non hotel staff soliciting and approaching you to sell services and accommodation at other hotels! - somewhat a_,,,,,,,,
c50731,s1,I was excited to try the new SPG property as Westin is just so old and so far away from everything,,,,,,,,
c50731,s2,Spent one night over a weekend,,,,,,,,
c50731,s3,"Overall I would say it's quite standard - rooms, amenities, etc",,,,,,,,
c50731,s4,Nothing wow as a brand new property,,,,,,,,
c50731,s5,Several things that bothered me:  1) Hotel is huge but the sign is not clear,,,,,,,,
c50731,s6,2) Sound proof - people and kids walking around,,,,,,,,
c50731,s7,it was quite noisy inside the room,,,,,,,,
c50731,s8,3) Checkin line - waited for a while even as an elite member,,,,,,,,
c50731,s9,Staffs need more training,,,,,,,,
c50731,s10,Good points:  1) SPG points 2) breakfast at SPG Club is good (but super crowded)  I think Holiday Inn nearby is for better value and Conrad might be more luxury - which makes Sheraton's position a bit awkward,,,,,,,,
c50732,s1,Day 1- nothing in any of the material I had been sent indicated there was a shuttle bus from Ferry terminal to hotel,,,,,,,,
c50732,s2,"People from the Venetian Hotel graciously assisted, as not a sign, or person was in the arrival area to guide",,,,,,,,
c50732,s3,Most major hotels had some form of information posted in arrivals area,,,,,,,,
c50732,s4,"- checked in Club level room, and 20 minutes later, 3 giggling young people walked in the room with no warning, knock or any notification while I was in the bathroom",,,,,,,,
c50732,s5,"""Checking on water"" I was told",,,,,,,,
c50732,s6,Nice room overlooking a construction site with pile drivers banking away most of the day,,,,,,,,
c50732,s7,Day 2- Long line up to the breakfast lounge on Club level,,,,,,,,
c50732,s8,"It was suggested I proceed to main restaurant where the food was said to be better, but at a $20+ cost",,,,,,,,
c50732,s9,Room cleaned at 4:30pm Day 3 - It's_,,,,,,,,
c50733,s1,"This is a HUGE hotel, presently approx",,,,,,,,
c50733,s2,"3'000 rooms - of which 570 are CLUB rooms, soon upgrading to 6'000 rooms",,,,,,,,
c50733,s3,"And doe to this everything is huge and very, very crowded, the reception, the lobby, the ""Club Lounge""",,,,,,,,
c50733,s4,"If you don't have any SPG tier - good luck, you'll wait",,,,,,,,
c50733,s5,If you have Gold tier you'll wait some minutes,,,,,,,,
c50733,s6,I do have Platinum tier with SPG so normally I would be entitled to check in at the Club Lounge,,,,,,,,
c50733,s7,Sadly they told me this when I already went through the line at Gold tier check-in (even I told them that I do have Platinum status),,,,,,,,
c50733,s8,"Okay, up to the lounge",,,,,,,,
c50733,s9,"Everything is huge, but missing style and flair",,,,,,,,
c50733,s10,"Just nothing has any style, just like the standard 3* US chain hotel",,,,,,,,
c50733,s11,We were upgraded to an Executive Suite which is really nice - but you've to walk and walk_,,,,,,,,
c50734,s1,"I have spent one night in this hotel and was really disappointed, the quality of the service and the organisation was poor for such a Hotel which pretends to have 5 stars",,,,,,,,
c50734,s2,I had to wait an hour in the queue to check in then 20 minutes to get my bag at the concierge because they have lost it,,,,,,,,
c50734,s3,When I finally get to my room the keycard was not working,,,,,,,,
c50734,s4,"The room was Ok, swimming pool was small and without any charm",,,,,,,,
c50734,s5,"Another issue, I had to pay for the breakfast which was included",,,,,,,,
c50734,s6,I had to negotiate another 15 minutes to remove it from my bill (by the way the checkout took me 20 more minutes),,,,,,,,
c50734,s7,It cost me 400,,,,,,,,
c50734,s8,#NAME?,,,,,,,,
c50734,s9,Even a nice Palace is not that expensive,,,,,,,,
c50734,s10,My recommendation is definitely_ do not go there_,,,,,,,,
c50735,s1,The hotel was just one-month-old when I visited there,,,,,,,,
c50735,s2,"When the coach arrived at the doorway of this new hotel, I was impressed as it gave me a subtropical resort feel",,,,,,,,
c50735,s3,"When we stepped in, dancers in Haiwaiian(?) costumes were performing",,,,,,,,
c50735,s4,Behind them was the casino,,,,,,,,
c50735,s5,"The room is a standard one, yes, a very standard one",,,,,,,,
c50735,s6,"All elements of a hotel room you would expect from a Sheraton group are all included, no surprise at all",,,,,,,,
c50735,s7,What bothered me was the lighting control,,,,,,,,
c50735,s8,"Like many other hotel rooms, one cannot control all the lights from the bedside",,,,,,,,
c50735,s9,"Service is good, the hardware is new at least",,,,,,,,
c50735,s10,"Not very easy to get a cab, it takes time",,,,,,,,
c50735,s11,So you may want to remain in Taipa for most of the time,,,,,,,,
c50735,s12,"Tried breakfast at Feast, no good",,,,,,,,
c50735,s13,"If it is not included, I think you may give_",,,,,,,,
c50736,s1,Bad housekeeping - 1,,,,,,,,
c50736,s2,missing toothpaste in the toothbrush packing,,,,,,,,
c50736,s3,"When we called guest service, they said there should be toothpaste inside every package of toothbrush, so that it may be opened by other guest",,,,,,,,
c50736,s4,How can we ensure the hygiene of it? 2,,,,,,,,
c50736,s5,There was only one used sheet in the memo pad,,,,,,,,
c50736,s6,The housekeeping didn't notice and replace it,,,,,,,,
c50736,s7,3,,,,,,,,
c50736,s8,"There was a UNICEF ""check out for children"" promotion card but it was full of scribbles",,,,,,,,
c50736,s9,The housekeeping didn't notice and replace it,,,,,,,,
c50736,s10,5,,,,,,,,
c50736,s11,We stayed for 2 nights,,,,,,,,
c50736,s12,"On the second night, we found that the small foil cover from the toothpaste that we used in the previous night was still lying on the floor of bathroom, together with some hairs",,,,,,,,
c50736,s13,Obviously the housekeeping did not clean the bathroom floor thoroughly,,,,,,,,
c50736,s14,Unacceptable view - When we_,,,,,,,,
c50737,s1,Stayed one night on an SPG points and cash award,,,,,,,,
c50737,s2,"The hotel was nice but the service was problematic beginning with a door key that wouldn't open and ending with a 20 minute ""normal"" checkout",,,,,,,,
c50737,s3,Also my wifi amenity didn't work and after 20 minutes trying to rectify it I gave up,,,,,,,,
c50737,s4,"In the 12 hours I spent in the hotel, I spent over an hour dealing with service related issues",,,,,,,,
c50737,s5,"Although I don't expect  service agents in another country to speak perfect English, the agents English skills were challenged anytime something went off script and made solving simple problems an ordeal",,,,,,,,
c50737,s6,I trust these problems will iron themselves out over time but for now I give the hotel 3 stars for room quality but 1 star for service,,,,,,,,
c50737,s7,"Incidentally, I talked to a female manager about my service related_",,,,,,,,
c50738,s1,"In-room Facilities:  1) Good to find iHome in the room 2) light attached with mirror inside the bathroom was out of order 3) should have hints to tell room guests all facilities / services provided by the hotel were shown on TV! As i normally won't switch on the TV in the room, I finally found the info til 7pm (4 hrs after check in!) 4) No spa treatment menu / leaflet inside the room (even in yr website!)",,,,,,,,
c50738,s2,It's ridiculous ! This is one of the hottest locations for ladies! I need to go there to check it out in person!  Other facilities  1) no staff standby in the changing room next to the fitness centre / swimming pools,,,,,,,,
c50738,s3,"The steamroom seemed not hot enough (I stayed there more than 15 min, but still feel warm only, no sweating at all) 2) it's a surprise no Jacazzui available with_",,,,,,,,
c50739,s1,I have been a member of the SPG since 2007 and I stayed at this hotel to celebrate my own birthday with my friends and this stay with this hotel is the worse stay that I have ever experienced since 2007 with the following reasons:-  1,,,,,,,,
c50739,s2,"when I checked in, the staff at front desk me that I need to check out the deluxe room on and then check-in again for the club room",,,,,,,,
c50739,s3,"After complaining to a member of a staff at the front desk, I save the hustle of checking out and checking in for changing from deluxe room to club room",,,,,,,,
c50739,s4,"However, when a member of the staff brought me to the club room, the staff put me into a twins bed club room rather than thr originally booked double bed room",,,,,,,,
c50739,s5,"As a result, I have to wait in the twins club room for 30 minutes",,,,,,,,
c50739,s6,2,,,,,,,,
c50739,s7,After making my_,,,,,,,,
c50740,s1,We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights and have checked into a Suite on the 39F which included Lounge service,,,,,,,,
c50740,s2,"Unfortunately we arrived after 9pm and there was no more food service, not even drinks, we got bottled water, better than nothing",,,,,,,,
c50740,s3,"The lounge closed at 11pm, doors closed with no more access",,,,,,,,
c50740,s4,"We would expect that the room would stay open for guests to sit around or use the internet, but I suppose you should all be going to the casino? The buffet breakfast looked good but there were flies in the seating area outside while the inside AC was freezing cold",,,,,,,,
c50740,s5,"When we returned to our floor, there were cigarette butts sitting on the trash can and a bag of leftover takeout food sitting next to it",,,,,,,,
c50740,s6,"These items remained there all day and thru the night, still there when we checked_",,,,,,,,
c50741,s1,As captioned,,,,,,,,
c50741,s2,"Had felt the front desk staff are kinda SQUARE to handle late check out request, as a over 3,000 rooms international branded hotel, a guest like me to celebrate their grand opening with my trail stay",,,,,,,,
c50741,s3,a little request for late checkout which was rejected 3 times by the same receptionist that made me really despair,,,,,,,,
c50741,s4,"I love the lobby lounge, Palm",,,,,,,,
c50741,s5,"Great band, good singers 'n nice saxophone player!!  The waitress, Nana is pretty friendly 'n full of smiling",,,,,,,,
c50741,s6,"The manager, Park is helpful 'n nice",,,,,,,,
c50741,s7,Whole thing made me feel enjoyable under a marvelous sentiments,,,,,,,,
c50742,s1,I was expecting this to be of a higher tier than the Holiday Inn at Cotai Sands however I was so wrong,,,,,,,,
c50742,s2,Check in lobby was HUGE with flocks of people,,,,,,,,
c50742,s3,"Then after checking in, no one to show where to catch the lift to room (spent a little time to find), then literally from lift to room took 2 minutes to walk to",,,,,,,,
c50742,s4,"Room was dusty and dimly lit (even when lights were all  on), no view from window (looks at a piece of construction land), toilet was basic and plastic bags were hard to open (for tooth paste and shower cap etc)",,,,,,,,
c50742,s5,Bathing amenities felt cheap,,,,,,,,
c50742,s6,Slippers were also paper thin,,,,,,,,
c50742,s7,I found it particularly bad value with Sheraton's brand,,,,,,,,
c50742,s8,Disappointed,,,,,,,,
c50743,s1,"Despite the more prestigious hotel brand name, this is fundamentally just a slightly nicer version of the Sands and Venetian hotels",,,,,,,,
c50743,s2,Same fundamental approach,,,,,,,,
c50743,s3,"Ie Big, noisy, cookie cutter service",,,,,,,,
c50743,s4,"Rooms are bland and basic (we were already in the more expensive suits), amenties basic, no sense of real luxury",,,,,,,,
c50743,s5,Strongly targeted for the mainland crowd,,,,,,,,
c50743,s6,It wasn't that full and even then the SPG Lounge was not able to cater for us at Breakfast,,,,,,,,
c50743,s7,"The Spa was the only brighter spot, despite facilities not being finished, the treatment was quite good",,,,,,,,
c50744,s1,There are so many hotels in Macau and it is very hard to be the best one,,,,,,,,
c50744,s2,Sheraton said this is the biggest hotel in the world,,,,,,,,
c50744,s3,I am not sure about this,,,,,,,,
c50744,s4,There are 2 towers (one is not open yet) but it doesn't seem like THAT big,,,,,,,,
c50744,s5,We've stayed at the executive suite for a night,,,,,,,,
c50744,s6,We checked in at the club lounge,,,,,,,,
c50744,s7,Service is good but I think it takes a bit longer than I thought,,,,,,,,
c50744,s8,The room itself is spacious,,,,,,,,
c50744,s9,The decor is very modern,,,,,,,,
c50744,s10,Our room is facing the other tower but there's nothing much to see,,,,,,,,
c50744,s11,"When you look down, you see the swimming pools plus a lot of big machines",,,,,,,,
c50744,s12,I don't really understand why they don't cover up those big machines at the podium level (same level as swimming pool),,,,,,,,
c50744,s13,50% of the room is looking at that and it doesn't seems like the best thing to see,,,,,,,,
c50744,s14,_,,,,,,,,
c50745,s1,"When we stay there, Sheraton just opened a week",,,,,,,,
c50745,s2,They really need to think about to improve to meet 5-star standard,,,,,,,,
c50745,s3,"Room - Nothing special, room space like other Macau hotel",,,,,,,,
c50745,s4,Working table is stainlesssteel one like using at office,,,,,,,,
c50745,s5,weird! Swimming Pool - just open 1 floor (they should have another floor?),,,,,,,,
c50745,s6,"Pool area divided several small pool, you will not like it if you really want to swim! Club Lounge - Breakfast & happy hour at night is okay",,,,,,,,
c50745,s7,"However, afternoon tea is really disappointed!!  Only prawn / fish / rice crackers & marsmallow everyday",,,,,,,,
c50745,s8,no hot items nor petit cake!  They should consider to provide finger sandwiches / toasts! Casino - very small and not connected with Holiday Inn/Conrad one Food - only tried noodle in the food court,,,,,,,,
c50745,s9,It is okay but not much_,,,,,,,,
c50746,s1,Bottom Line: Would only recommend staying at this hotel if you get a very cheap packaged deal,,,,,,,,
c50746,s2,"Otherwise, it's definitely not 5 star quality yet, and still lacking in service",,,,,,,,
c50746,s3,"Besides the kind greetings in the lobby, ""hi and welcome"" the staff are not experienced enough in english, making it a very frustrating experience",,,,,,,,
c50746,s4,"Try asking anyone where the food court is, or how express checkout works, where the shuttle bus is, etc",,,,,,,,
c50746,s5,and you'll see a bunch of blank faces,,,,,,,,
c50746,s6,"Cons:  - HORRIBLE view, despite being a SPG member",,,,,,,,
c50746,s7,"Got a view of the back of the hotel facing all the ventilation systems, pipes, you know what I mean etc",,,,,,,,
c50746,s8,That's what happens when you book a cheap promotional package,,,,,,,,
c50746,s9,They give you the worst rooms,,,,,,,,
c50746,s10,#NAME?,,,,,,,,
c50746,s11,The one that is open is_,,,,,,,,
c50747,s1,Checked in on 29/9/12 and stayed for one night in the club floor,,,,,,,,
c50747,s2,I am still in the room as I am writing this review,,,,,,,,
c50747,s3,It's such a big disappointment with such an ordinary room,,,,,,,,
c50747,s4,Not luxurious and 5 star at all,,,,,,,,
c50747,s5,"It makes it a lot worse when I had paid $2861 HKD, equivalent to $366 USD, for it",,,,,,,,
c50747,s6,"WiFI is unstable, on and off every 10-20 seconds",,,,,,,,
c50747,s7,"It was really frustrating! When I booked, the hotel was not opened yet, so no review was available",,,,,,,,
c50747,s8,"As Sheraton was a brand name and never stayed at one, I gave it a go believing it could not go too wrong with a five-star hotel",,,,,,,,
c50747,s9,How wrong I was as the room was so ORDINARY! It definitely had turned me off the Sheraton brand forever,,,,,,,,
c50748,s1,I don't recommend this hotel specially for special occasion as it ruined ours,,,,,,,,
c50748,s2,We got ours under $HKD1000 but still I was quite disappointed with the room and the service received,,,,,,,,
c50748,s3,More like a 3* hotel,,,,,,,,
c50748,s4,"Location was good as close to Venetian, City of Dreams etc but check-in staff were extremely rude",,,,,,,,
c50748,s5,Waited for 1/2 hour and very frustrating our special request were not noted down in the system with the staff accusing us of making it up until we showed her email which confirmed our request,,,,,,,,
c50748,s6,Still unable to fulfill a simple request and unapologetic,,,,,,,,
c50748,s7,Very impersonal service and staff seemed frustrated,,,,,,,,
c50748,s8,"Other staff encountered was ok, best customer service were the greeters at the lifts",,,,,,,,
c50748,s9,"Only 1 out of 4 pools were opened, with the rest opening sometime next year",,,,,,,,
c50748,s10,No swim-up bar_,,,,,,,,
c50749,s1,"Decent hotel but not as good as I expected for the Sheraton brand, or for a 5 star hotel in Macau of today's standard",,,,,,,,
c50749,s2,"First of all, spent over an hour for check-in because the hotel could not verify my booking for 3 guests requesting an extra bed via Hotel",,,,,,,,
c50749,s3,com,,,,,,,,
c50749,s4,"I paid almost double of the promotion price launched by the hotel for a regular twin room so that I can have 3 guests sharing and requested for an extra bed, but the hotel staff said the increased payment was only a deal between myself and Hotel",,,,,,,,
c50749,s5,"com, and I would need to pay additional fees for the extra bed",,,,,,,,
c50749,s6,"Except for my name and booking reference, my personal details such as phone number, address and credit card number were wrong in their system",,,,,,,,
c50749,s7,After almost an hour of information checking and negotiation they_,,,,,,,,
